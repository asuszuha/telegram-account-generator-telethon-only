Hi! With whom we can discuss the integration with exchanges??
Hello everyone
Good morning velas
I am waiting for.... I hope :rocket::rocket::rocket::rocket:
:four_leaf_clover:
Helo boyz will be velas on Consensus2022 crypto festival?
Ok tnx..its biggest festival in crypto from 9-12 june :)
hi
Kind reminder to all our friends out there - if anyone contacts you that is support and ask you to verify wallet and connect to some dodgy website is a 10000% SCAM!!! :grinning_face_with_sweat: Never connect your wallets and give the pleasure to those fucking scammers to drain your funds and steal your passphrase. WATCH OUT!!!
BTW i love wasting their time :face_with_tears_of_joy::thumbs_up: now that i am poor and jobless is the best entertainment i can have :OK_hand::grinning_face_with_big_eyes:
According to the events of the last few days, listing on Binance will have a negligible effect on the price of VLX.  We have to look for powerful adaptations and the best possible projects on the Velas network !! :crossed_fingers::beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Happy New Year
:face_with_tears_of_joy: (26)
I always knew that we all have a different view of space time...to wish me a happy new year on June 1st you feel it is someone different...
:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
I think my friend sophia is still in bull market:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
When I see the difference with etherum's fees...and here I saw that they are trying to lower bnb's fees too.... are they afraid of the competition?
Velas should be at least around 50 cent with all the solutions they offer. :face_with_tears_of_joy: (31)
:fire::index_pointing_up:
Better for us, buy more guys (32)
And yes my friend...but let's be patient and accumulate ....ojective minimum 100k of vlx before it starts....ca there I have all the scammers coming to contact me when they will see 100k:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
100k are so much much but it the perfect amount :man_tipping_hand_medium_skin_tone:
Sure!! (34)

Hello everyone
Hello, this information is outdated, these stakings in BW and Probit no longer exist.
is this token dead or active
I see Solana having issues again :man_shrugging:
Velas need to take over from them asap :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
When Velas to 1€?
True, but we're better, so would be good to take their market share :money-mouth_face::money-mouth_face:
Good night
Hello bogdanovThey bought solana.Oki dump it
Good night
good start
guys what do you think about the project Arabic cash?
Hello
Hello
Who is ready for BTC at 22k ? :rocket:
Nobody (62)
22k or 6000usdt here is velas:winking_face:
Solana they have a headache....
I have headache with them....just took some pills after seing the charts :see-no-evil_monkey: anyway i am not selling. Sticking to the plan is the hardest part to success (65)
Unfortunately for them and othersblockchain is a kind of chance for velas to observe the mistakes of others in order to avoid this kind of inconvenience on its own blockchain...morality..keep filling your bag with vlx!
You read my mind. Velas watching from sidelines for the github repos to be updated and taking the good without experiencing the bad. By the time Solana Beta switch to Mainnet stable 1.0 Velas will be in poll position for the race :thumbs_up: (67)
Everyone is affected by the drop, but solana bugs severely.... and these are mistakes that velas will try not to make
In short, all that remains is for me to put my purchase orders in place...good evening to all
Pills take effect on me too...shot of wisky and turning the lights off. Good night everyone (GMT +3):flexed_biceps:
Hello everyone
VLX Eat them ALL
VELAS has the time and the opportunity to see and avoid some issues that Some Others are doing!!! at the same time, VLX can take their place, SO people, talk about us, Buy, Hold, Stake and again, repeat, BUY, HOLD, Stake and talk about VLX
VLX talking!
WE are Here!
Agreed. Wondering did solana team reach out to velas team for help. :thinking_face:
Any admin here, can I send screenshot?
Vlx is fork of salona how if salona s few project get shifted to vlx is there is any chance  happening in future
I really hope, because it is a very Bad news the solana bug
Good Morning Velas
Buy vlx, pump is coming
2 year
The sol outage and Luna crash may be a good opportunity for vlx to increase its ecology!
n hao
Because the money come in. Now all money come out
The whale
Did Velas successfully get some projects from LUNA following its crash? (84)
Are we reaching out to Solana devs? Their network is also crashing
Any news bitorbit?
Hi :waving_hand:
salam dadash khuby ye sual dashtam manzur az staking chie ?
mumkene pul az dast bere ?
This week is boring
Nothing new
​​Now you can buy $VLX seamlessly and securely from the #VelasWallet via Simplex using a debit card, credit card, or Apple Pay.We’ve also added a button on the website where you can try a new way to buy Velas ($VLX).
I think it will be lateral for a long moment (94)
Haha
Non hossein quieter than that
At least no one's crying...like..why does it dump?what happens to velas?when binance?too much supply?
Comunity indonesia ?
Am I allowed to call myself velas on call off duty or do I risk a lawsuit?
Ok:smirking_face:
Hello, I sent VLX from my Velas EVM wallet on Metamask to Gate io using ETH address on Gate. I can see the transferred balance on evmexplorer velas com website when I check the receiving wallet address, but not reflected to Gate balance yet. Did I fail to transfer the funds and make something wrong?
So there will no more be Bluezilla backed projects launched on velaspad?
Hi guys, after a bit of help please.looking at buying Velas.  but a bit confused i thought velas, was a solana fork,  but it seems if i buy it, i am buying it on ethereum ?is that right ?  i thought it would be on solana ?
Thankyou,  so its not on solana ?  is that right ?
cheers, so you can buy on bsc also ?  ie to save on gas fee's?
It seems like more people have velas on BSC then ETH.   would BSC be better ?   cheers for your answers mate
ok cheers, so how do i buy it on the velas blockchain ?  for example if i buy it on pancake swap, isnt that on/using ethereum ?
Ok, thankyou.  So how do you recommend i buy velas on  bsc or eth or eth ?there is 46,959 addresses on bsc,   and only   2400 on etherscan.so seems like more people buy on bsc.is there any issues with buying on bsc,  can i still stake etc, if i buy on bsc.sorry for the million questiosn
Poocoin:face_with_tears_of_joy:
thankyou, but i dont want to use fiat.basically, just trying to confirm if the following is correct.1.  bsc seems to be the more popular chain to buy Velas on ?   yes/ no ?2.  Can you stake velas bought on bsc in the velas wallet ?  yes/no ?cheers
But Velas team must be sure that we do not have the same Bug (54)
Sad, they bring a lot of good projects with many x-es.
Cheers mate, so when you say most liquidity is in the native token,  that is the ethereum address right ?  but that only has 2400 accounts on it
And Velaspad is their official launchpad?
So just watched that video,  if i buy velas on the bsc chain, can i change it to velas native on that wallet ? (116)
Nothing about Velaspad in that article
awesome,  thankyou
Ah, so it's an independent launchpad, not a part of official Velas products.
What is the current apy for staking ?
Thanks!
When launched, vlx absolutely explodes!
Thanks.
When listing on binance?
Will we get to Binance?
really
When
Hello everyone
Will list after the day announcement is make. (129)
That is known, it seems that if it is certain that we will reach Binance if not it is not said in public here (131)
I agree with you (132)
No
Wait
Buy more
We have to go more down
Because I have to buy. More :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Please wait for binance

No, btc still have to spread some blood. On leveraged positions
Of course. (132)
You can buy now. (137)
No

Btc is still dropping :relieved_face::relieved_face:
Hello everyone
No wonder it down. All because of this mindset (147)
We are not il bull market you know?
The contrary
Scam (149)
Can still be stable even in bear market if community have strong positive mindset.
If BINANCE arrives it will explode
Opinion are not money bro
x3 at least
Price will grow if the market cap grow (155)
Not really in this situation (155)
Are you newbie?
Check out those newly listed on binance how they perform.
You? (160)
Not you
I mean enrique
Those who think listed on binance sure pump are still in old good time.
Is not time for being rag pulled
I'm not a beginner but you're going to ask a beginner question, do you think VLX reaches 1 dollar after listing on binance? I know it's possible, but I would like to know if it's PROBABLE
Best option now is hold
You don’t lose if you don’t sell (168)
Market cap growPrice grow (167)
Of course (170)
Btc is not that bearish guys
Retailers
My opinion is always same and consistent - yes only when market is "really" in stable. Not those saw 1 or 2 days increase and called it recovered. (167)
I fully agreed and believed.
Its clear where the journey is going, stay positive and patient!
Velas is something totally new, nobody knows the project, the majority of the people that know velas just dont really understand the chain and its benefits.
If btc really bearish. Market is double bearish. Whether you like it or not: when btc down every 1% market down 2-5x. When btc up 1% market not necesary up or max up 0.25-0.50%. (172)
I see elon musk posting about velas in 5 years
Or something crazy like that
Velas is still very small
Hello everyone
Right. Time to sleep. Is 1.15am here. Stay positive. :thumbs_up: (177)
Good night steney :thumbs_up:
Help
Thanks. :thumbs_up: (184)
Absolutely not, the contrary
And I can't advice any coin
Dyor
Bro if btc pump, then the other coins will pumpIf btc dump, then all the market will go down
hi
any list of new dapps coming to velas ?
any idea when the oracles are coming to velas?
Thank you. I was under the impression that one or two oracles would be on velas soon
Yes, people are hoping tidex can do the same as Qmall and getting into vlxpad
Good luck (195)
Tidex, just a new Ido launching on vlxpad(plus some of their other pads), it's an exchange I believe, not looked into it much to be honest
Tindex...sounds like tinder:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy: it must be a crypto for libertine swingers
This is the space to ask about VelasSloth project?
Is this*
Good night, everyone
Yes. Vlx is listed there as well. Not an official listing. They listed vlx themselves. (197)
Hello everyone
Since VLX is based on SOL, when SOL goes down does VLX go down aswell?
Is the team public?
Good to know. Is the team public?
Where can I read about them? Didnt see it on About Us on the website.
What's the maximum token supply, and unlock schedule?
Thank you. What is the maximum token supply?
:waving_hand::waving_hand:

What’s the APY on staking and what platform can I stake on
thanks
Pls where can I stake
Two questions: 1. Is there any project been built on this network at the moment and how many 2. Is this network on Mainnet yet ?
Are you looking to reduce velas supply?
Ok
What is the max supply currently
And what is the current MC
do you have list of projects being built?
Is this correct?
Yes

why is wag bad ?? (233)
i guess your answer fits more the comment of the other guy :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:))
Hello!New here
I have a question.  How can I stake Velas in Trust Wallet?
Hello! :waving_hand::slightly_smiling_face:
anybody familiar with velas blockchain mechanics here?
I have a question , As forked from Soalna, does Velas still utilise Proof of history? are Blockchain entries, timestamped from central source?
adn I have been messaged by 'mod' to join a large group where people are asking for wallet addresses, that is a scam?
Wow you have people callignto scam as well?
worst experience joining a group ever
yoru mods need to do soemthing better
no admin or mod should EVER contact first.
Perfect
So we are considering moving our project to velas then.
Yes i know this others may not
Sol up time has been a worry and finding competent rust devs has also been challenging.
Being able to work in Solidity will make it much easier and faster to roll out
What exchanges is Velas available on?
ah all eth. dexes
Any plans to have FTm or AVax bridging?
I love this.
Our project is a real world to Defi NFT property Bond market,am I allowed to link in here?
Hello
www.meta-fin.tech
oh i am not allowed to link lol
well its meta-fin and then dot tech. We were working of Solana, but if Velas DOES work with POH as well. I think we should pivot.
Thanks for the help, will discuss with team.
Gm ppl
Can I buy this in pancake swap?
Agree need new defi… good team… wag bad management of supply (233)
Should have a glance at what we are building. (271)
Need independent dex…. Quality dex
Wasnt in our original scope and could hinder us, but an algo stable with NFT property bonds is what we are building full real world marketplace utility.
We did want to build a profit optimisation autocompounder and insurance pools
But we will need competent dexes to create lps from.
Now lots of people have eyes on velas because of solana outage. If they can really pull out it would go crazy in the coming months
exactly why i am here
are there velas wrapped analogues of eth tokens?
so WFTM for eg that works on velas chain, nobody wants to faff about with too much bridging and fee leakages
I love this project next few years it will boom
hmm why nothing for a month, and 41 addresses.. very low.. Maybe too early.
Agree 100% no trust BZ project… all down below ido price… red flag (276)
Take a look at wagyuswap !!:OK_hand: nr.1 dex on Velas ;) (276)
when is pamp?:crying_face:
Buy a pump and you got it.
Contact me in PM for help!
Pamp soon...bull cross on 3 days MACD (285)
why did we fork with SOL? What happend?
why dont we have a limited supply? it means we have unlimited supply, not written in the white paper, why didnt you make it limited?
is there burning of coins?
thanks for all the answers
Oh.  Thats not so exciting..
Today it feels like a day of questions and blame...put on your bulletproof vest hossein....ca is going to pumper in the blame....too much supply, when binance, what do we do with solana??why does it dump? Good luck to the Velas team!
Something interesting i was researching today...SOL is backed by some big VC and the biggest supporter of Solana is FTX. Now to extrapolate what means that for Velas (btw my own personal opinion)- Ensures long term development and code integration- Solid market- Expanding utility in various sectors- Growing community- Seamless bridging Overal recent downtime of Solana did not worry me at all. It just reminded me the early days of Cisco when they were facing all issues releasing their iOS for switches and WAPs and their firewalls. Took time, but Cisco is now globally respected brand for industrial scale network setups - reliable and fast
With a little time and patience I made myself a little bag of vlx, I think that one day it will start and we will laugh about all these questions and reproaches :victory_hand:
So BNB is backed by Binance, SOL is backed by FTX, Coinbase is with USDC so in other words the biggest exchanges in the world are leading force behind the biggest projects in the crypto space. Thus why i am so bulish for Velas as they get listed on more and more exchanges
Most L1 inflation for validator rewards
I always like to give a comparison with Snadbox and Velas...anyone interested just check on circulating supply for both to see the difference. Sandbox wont recover...just pumped and dumped and still has lot of coins not in circulation and what actual utility it provides?? Velas has almost all their tokens in circulation. Realistically speaking VLX should be in range of 70c to $1 and even that is still undervalued at the moment. But it will come soon:flexed_biceps::thumbs_up: (296)
if supply is infinite this analysis is incorrect. (299)
any inflation at all is a completely unworkable paradigm
IF we want somethign to go down in value over time, we have fiat
Really disappointed at this.
and for that reason. Im out.
Contact me in PM for help!

Hi guys? What is happening with Bitorbit? We don't have any news fir ages and this is a Velas core team official project.The twitter account is suspended and everything about this looks abandoned
Perfect. So it will restart then and not abandoned
Anyone looking forward to buying more and anticipating a further dump in price of vlx???

happy weekend
Great!
What partnership we have? It's a game on velas or more chains?
OK thanks
has anyone had any issues claiming BMF tokens from the highest private velaspad tier??
Does vlx have discord ?
Thx
Quick question for anyone… how can safecoin and vlx basically be forks ofSolana but be launched beforeSolana was launched ?
Or am I confused lol
When was Solana launched ? On cg it says around 2020 but vlx is 2019
That has to be wrong right
Hello everyone
What about Solana ?
Straw hat as well? (330)
Ahahaha
Yeah bro
Ooooo ok I understand now
Yeah just found out about it today on twitter.. with a comment saying it’s a Solana fork but I now know it is not
Why
hi guy is this solana fork ?    is this beta version like solana?
Help
:waving_hand:
:waving_hand:
Soon enough
Go go go team!!:fire::fire::mechanical_arm:
Hello
Buy tax??
As velas is a fork of solana, is it prone to same issues?
Mainly trading spot orders not executed faster
Great. Then, it is a matter of time when people will know about it
Anywhere we can stake velas?
Do you have an announcement channel. Thanks
Good morning

Hey guys, I just started to stake a few days ago on the Ferrari validator but it now says "inactive" next to it, what does it mean ? is it because the node is down at the moment ?
Thanks, would you recommend to wait a bit or to unstake and stake on another node ?
Hi, yesterday I finally swapped my BEP20 VLX to Native and put it into Staking :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:Have read through the warmup and cooldown, but unfortunately do not quite get it. Now 25% is added per epoch until 100% is reached and then the whole thing again when paying out. Is that correct so far? How long does an epoch last and when do my VLX start earning rewards when I put them in last night?
Hi xavier even if the validator fees are higher when you are on your wallet select the validators with the lowest and highest dominance...
Then you do as you like, of course, but that's what I did.
Perfekt thank you :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Hi to all the positive team of velas !!!!ca is not crying too much today?bitorbit ,supply,the project is weak,when binance,a new dex?why this dump...
If the project takes off we should make kleenex velas...
hello
They are on vacation. :face_with_tears_of_joy: (370)
I would like to build it velas
Am I good to go with that?
Woah thank you
haha
what do you think about wagyuswap and astroswap ?
hello guys I have a question if sol down; would That affect vlx?
We are not Solana (379)
Solana is a young protocol fomed
Hello everyone, have you had a great weekend?
Breathe. Relax. Focus on something that makes your day brighter.
Our price not depend from Solana
No (384)
What happened to velaspad?
Thanks. Is there a list of projects built on velas?
Hey anybody home
Hey so I have been in the community for a while and I was thinking of creating an NFT collection ( it will be free mint - meaning users won't have to pay to mint it  ). But am not sure how to go about it( I have the art traits & design ready ). I don't know if I should submit some form of verification or not. So just let me know.
Do I have to submit a verification even though if a free to mint or should I just deploy it and submit the website so users can claim their NFT from the blockchain
The reason for asking is I haven't seen anyone here launching a project talking about a project. That why am asking
The use and the adoption make the price
Someone should create nft monsters with the ability to breed, spending vlx (90% burn)
Hello! For transferring Vlx from metamask (velas network) to velas wallet. I should direct it to velas native right?
:eyes::fire::smiling_face_with_sunglasses: (363)
Ok. And staking on native?
Thank you man!
Hi
I am not bot
Please adm I want a group spanish language or frensh

Thank you
i need the token address. Already have the network added
yea. sorry

Ok so here's what i'm struggling with. I bought VLX via swapz but it's not showing in my wallet. I've added the token contract to the ETH chain and BSC chain but nothing showing up. I'm thinking that because it should show up in my Velas network, am i right?
I mean.. I think bought VLX. Maybe I just swapped my busd to Velas BUSD. (421)
I converted BUSD on the swapz platform
So Binance
So yeah, seems like you've just converted your binnace busd to busd on velas (423)
Just use wagyuswap to buy vlx with that busd (if it's vlx your after).
It worked! @Sylvester_G helped me out
Hi  thereI can get you upvote and stars on CoinGecko, CMCTrending coingecko and crypto comList cg & cmc And we have High speed in finishingwho can I dm to make a deal?

Hello
How to count rewards staking on velas wallet?
This is great!
hey everybody
Why the price continue dropping? Is there minting function or what?
Who is selling, I wonder? I continue buying from 0,5 till 0,07
But is the dump even any close to the end?
@Sylvester_G Can you check dm?
What kind of a hit, I wonder? And is Velas so tightly connected with a sol?
Thanks for feedback! Volume 436 - is it high or low? Is it an all exchanges or some?
Do you think Viet Nam is a very potential market? CZ have just come to Viet Nam to join their Blockchain conference.
And their government is forming a Blockchain Foundation
I think Velas shouldn't miss this country.
I remember a Carlos Matos conference there :slightly_smiling_face: (440)
I wonder. Will Velas reach $8?
That’s good to know (407)
I’ve go this interesting work on my tab lately
What’s that? (445)
It adlunam (447)
It’s an IDO platform for investors
Which is a proof of attention launch pad for projects
Not really getting what you’re saying mate (450)
Hit the nail in the head man
The market is improving   niiiiiice
Goodmorning everyone,When will the max supply be made public? I want to know if there can be extra minting before I invest
Adlunam is the industry’s first NFT-integrated Engage to Earn seed crowdfunding and IDO launchpad using a Proof of Attention model (452)
100% (455)
You know about it right ?
Yeah I do (457)
Have made little research on it
Is this written in the contract or done manually? Like how does that process work?
Nice!! (459)
Thanks
AdLunamInc have great potential. Why? Because this project is working on a #Launchpad as an initiative to help any kind of project to grow within the #Crypto market exponentially!
Check it out
I love velas
Hello vlx team, first of all acknowledge that vlx has a great vision, but there is a big problem with the current token economy model. The inflationary model is a big burden on the project without an ecosystem and no one will pay for an inflationary currency. go look at BNB which is also all deflationary model. Investors are looking to grow and add value with the project. The fiat currency itself is bad enough for inflation, so why try an inflationary model in a digital currency? And vlx is a DPOS itself many early investors have been able to make a steady stream of profits through pledging, so how do you make it profitable for later investors? Think about it, there are many, many good projects in the world of cryptocurrencies and no one wants to pay for others.
Don't bother with other items, you should consider your own monetary model, inflation means devaluation of the currency. Can you tell us about the benefits of inflation? Why is it designed this way
Why is no one even coming to buy and insisting on inflation? Inflation without demand
So the validator can always arbitrage? What about other investors? They will keep suppressing the price and who will pay for the additional issue?
So everyone comes to pledge and then get the reward to sell for arbitrage, then the value of vlx will keep going lower
So the incentive profit on pledges tends to be close to zero? Then the investment is worthless
We don't see the point at which it can grow.
Bitcoin will always be 2100W, when was it ever increased? Ether too, BNB is even deflationary.
One should look to these growing projects to learn from, rather than crap like BTS, EOS.
The problem is that we don't need inflation, right? Why do we need inflation?
Why don't we let vlx add value to be attractive?
The verifier reward can come out of the total coin pool, although it is a DPOS, then the POW model, but also from the total amount of mining ah.
And POWs also halve in production every four years, which is one of the reasons why they are becoming scarce and sought after.
Think about it yourselves. If it is not profitable and I don't know what my reasons for investing in vlx are, then I have no choice but to quit. I hope you guys can get better and better.
No at btc, that is shown in max.
Happy weekend!
Hello. You are the only one i address with "Hello" because i totally don't agreed at your claim at all as your claim are 1-sided. Your statement itself has lots of big contradicting factors. 1st - you claim that Velas has great vision (so what the great vision in your opinion? Next how can it has not future if got great vision?). 2nd - yet you claim Velas has no ecosystem (then how can it be great vision if it without any ecosystem). 3rd - you claim investors are looking to invest and add values (what type of values are you refer to? purely on coin's price? that's not add values, that's purely invest on coin's price). Maybe you don't even know how to differential "pure coin's investor" and "project development investor". I was also surprise there was someone 2 days ago claim to be from project using SOL looking for alternative (but then also said not exciting after knowing about velas have inflation. Look like he is only looking for coin's price instead of good blockchain solution). (466)
/setdescription@Manybot
I really want to laugh at you and those who thumb up! :face_with_tears_of_joy: (473)
Why not you give "real good" suggestion to add values to overall Velas blockchain? Not just the simple word - burn. Be more real. :OK_hand: (476)
That's BTC model - i thought you said no good? :thinking_face: (478)
Thanks. We will. Within from outside. (479)
Spanish
How much inflation per year?
why do we have so many supply? there should be like voluntary burning of coins. Imagine all of us here 42355 members will voluntarily burn 100 VLX each, that would be 4235500 less VLX in circulation.But in return, those people who voluntarily burned their coins should be posted and be recognized by the community as "HEROES"
Thx and how much is tps 50k or 75k?
Let us stop talking bout inflation or anything debate, let do best for project ahead.I trust VLX will become great things in next future. (482)
I just sell dot to buy vlx
Not dot bdot
Any news is coming??
Actually vlx is better than sol in blockchain ability.Up to 75000 tps, and low gas fee, that is enough to attracted more investor i think. (493)
Every one people burn one of their VLXbut it seems impossiblehaha :grinning_face_with_sweat:
Definitely will. I don't even care about this little inflation for potentially huge velas ecosystem. It's those who don't have foresight and are unable to think objectively. (492)
1000% will. (496)
the things that most important than burn tokens are community expansion and continuing to develop the projects as well.
For sure I will not do this stupid thing for you.. (497)
Hi
Im working on a SocialFi project . My team are very positive that this project will draw the next hype on SocialFi. We are exploring a chain to launch the project.It would be great to partner with your chain on this project. Would you be able share more on how we can get listed on your chain?

Hello, if I want to stablish a local community for Velas, who should I talk to?

It's only a couple of days staking rewards, nothing major (543)
Check please
Don't worry, is the same (548)
For me is ok :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:

Yeah, was a shame that movez wasn't on velas aswell (569)

But something goes wrong
Arrrhhh, ok, didn't know that

Maybe we can collaborate with sweat coin
They are many things to bring people to velas

Haha its my money

Why you don't want send me your velas but you prefer burn it :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:

Hello. How can I get VLX to my wallet?
I just bought some on gate but when I want to send it to the vallet via velas chain it is not possible. Tokens just come back to exchange... where can be the problem?
I am using  VLX - native and sending to metamask and it is not possible
So I cant send vlx from gate to metamask?
Can't send on velas chain to metamask (you'll need to send to velas wallet and choose velas-native), or send to metamask on bsc chain, then bridge over to velas via swapz. (654)
Ok and then how can I bridge them to velas chain? Because on velaspad bridge you cant bridge VLX. So where can I bridge them?
Swapz dot app, but let admin provide a official link
If you have velas wallet, it'll be cheaper to send from gate to velas wallet and then swap within the velas wallet from native vlx to vlxevm and then send to metamask .The above will be cheaper then using swapz site (0.02bnb to swap there I believe)
When solve problems with Probit?
Can't he sent native vlx to his velas wallet and convert that to vlxevm within the wallet??
With metamask only?
If you only have matemask wallet and don't want to create yourself a velas wallet, you'll need to send your vlx from gate on bsc chain, then use swapz to bride over to velas (662)
Ok I can use the swapz. Can you give me the link plase?
Can't post links, only admin can
Ok thanks. I will try it (665)
To be able to send straight to metamask from an exchange, you have to use kucoin or Bitforex and send via vlxevm
HelloMigration from bep20 to native… is it 1st step swap to evm and step2 swap to native?

Hello
:waving_hand::waving_hand:
Hello Do validator rewards accrue on a wallet automatically or it is needed to claim them?
Thank you a lot Are they accrued on a wallet each epoch (~ 2 days)?
​​Velas strives to accelerate the network infrastructure development of Web3 through its $250M Fund & Accelerator Program. :eyes:Velas is looking to attract ambitious teams to join the efficient, scalable, and EVM-compatible Velas ecosystem.
I'm from Saudi Arabia:Saudi_Arabia: and I would love to establish an Arabic community for Velas.Any administration form to fill out?
I got your point The thing is that the amount of VLX on the wallet is the same during a bit more than 4 days, however, the rewards were accrued according to the website. Is it okay?
HelloCan someone refer me to the CMO/CEO/person in charge of marketing?‌‌
Okay
Ok. Thanks :thumbs_up:

If I understood correctlyWe have a release for 4 years.8% in one year32% for 4 yearsIn order to get from 7% to 15%Are we in the middle of inflation?
A new week will be better
Good morning
why big investors don't like velas is that cos the inflation??
No. Just that they are looking for quick money. Better without them. (702)
so why velas rank in cmc going down and down
Market is going up
Velas going dowm
On this quiet night, send my warm wishes and bring my deep nostalgia. May my blessing wash away your day's troubles.
Wag V2 will save vlx (704)
if the all market going down our rank will be stable but our rank is going down fast that mean is only velas now going downour rank was 100 few months agonow 165
From all these comments seem many doesn't know how to analyse. "It's so simple and obvious that some bad hand is targeting velas". (709)
Unfortunately within community still don't unite instead still throw negative comments. All these just fall into their trap.
iam not a bad hand i just wanna explain for why this happened (710)
Did i said you? I don't think (712)
Within this community must trust and unite. Don't fall into their trap. (712)
more people sell, than people buy, that is the reason (704)
Ha-ha! This is the most appropriate explanation! If a coin is hard to find, it will fly! (715)
Need independent quality teams to develop on velas… bad look all projects BZ (715)
This is surface. Dig deeper. Ask the 5 whys! (716)
No one gives an answer! (718)
Hello. Im from CRYPTO CITY. I have a business proposal its about doing an AMA, promoting, and listing token to Mexc/Bkex/Bibox/Hotbit Exchange. Who I can contact to work?
Who can give you an answer? (719)
This (710)
:sign_of_the_horns::kissing_cat:
Probably yes, for sure we need deflation to attract more investors (702)
Everything is going up on the market excepting vlx:man_facepalming_medium_skin_tone:
My major investment
Who is continuing selling, I won…
Wonder
What is the max supply @Hossein_velas
?
What is difference between VLX AND SOLANA project ?
Only asking. If Velas' offers almost zero fees, wich is tokens utility in the proyect? Thanks (Only asking, ok?)
I understand Velas ecosystem its pretty cool. But dont see Velas' token's utility.... Not only utility but the price of the token.
I think he means, if velas has fees of $0.0001 or so, why would anyone need to buy more than say 50-100 vlx, is there any other utility (I believe this is his question)
If the fees are low, for what should I buy (lot of) Vlx. So, if no buyers no price going up
Thats it (734)
Investing
So, maybe the mot powerfull feature at this moment is supporting PoS consensus, which is the soul of the project. Ok, thanks friend. Have a good day :)
hi
Just made a decision i think I will reach the 200,000 VLX tonight so I will just wait like a pimp for the price to reach the 1$ target :bullseye: hope a bull market begin soon
Hi, everybody:)
Do you think the market has stabilized? (740)
Wtf are u talking about (742)
Does velas really have PoS with IA? Or have you canceled that?
I have hearded about that velas has canceled that
For much work
Ohhh okey
Thanks
Wen binance and coinbase ?

Is it better to wait for another bull market than to list now? (749)

Hi i'm trying to bridge my velas busd to bsc but i got this error "Velas EVM balance (0) is not enough to send tx" Anybody know what it means?
That's right i sent even BNB but forgot to send VLX to velas EVM wallet let me try. Thanks
Better to warn specifically what is not enough in wallet app to get rid of simple questions. I thought bridge doesn't have BUSD to swap :)

Hello, I am a fullstack developer and have a lot of experience in web development and blockchain projects(Defi/NFT/Metaverse/Solana).Is there anyone who can engage me in a developer position in their project?Thank you..
if the inflation reach 1.5% is there will stop inflating or will stop reduced inflation?
Personal opinion, when velas has a few thousand projects with real use cases. This little inflation is nothing. (783)
Hope everything goes well (784)
Hopefully, looking forward (785)

Velas will replace Solana (828)
Okay, Question  - As we see there are some other chain like optimism, Trc20, BNB. If i want to use this chain then how i will use it? and whats the fees?
This right now is peak crypto-fear. If you are still sticking to Crypto you are truly a holder and you can go through the worst bear markets
That is too good but curious to know then why price broke down too much like 100%. Because of Solana or Bitcoin? but still 100% from VLX started this journey. 0.5 to 0.006
sorry 0.06
if i want send vlx from exchange to velas wallet, have bep 20 what wallet i need native evm legacy?
But you don't have bep 20 in velas wallet

Good night
This is the way
administrator why is this happening in PROBIT
It says invalid address and if the address is correct
Kucoin
EVM candles not the other
Kucoin doesn't support vlx legacy , this is the vlx that is on probit, you'll need to send to velas wallet vlx legacy address I believe, then bridge to vlxevm or vlx native and send to kucoin (890)
administrator can you give me the link of Velas Wallet
Just some marketing tips to velas team from one of my best coach in this domain, that i humbly know.A) If your grand ma and your nephew understand it. " It's a good Go-To-Market project. "B) If it still existing in at least 30 years. - It's "okay" to invest in it. -C) Have enough humility to admit you need others to learn AND if as a result IT permit the "things" to grow. - " Just get some coffee." -" You are on the right way.

Sir it's important for vlx to list on binance because it will vlx as well as investor and to the world

What moonboi means

We have the ideal scenario to conquer the market, especially due to the quality and capacity of VLX

Hi
Nice to meet you all.
Hello,I just have a simple question to the developers of Velas. My question is : What is the max supply of Velas that there could be or that is decided? And any specific time where the team is planing to sell some to cover expanses of development?
So you mean that the total amount of Velas is in an increasing curve yearly. But it increases between 1.5% ~ 8% yearly?Also any plans for burning the token or will the token continue to increase in the future?
Okey,But that still means that the supply will be increasing and not decreasing (depends how much of that in the market and how much % in cold wallets) But in general the curve of supply is going to continue to increase.
Yes,thanks for answer :thumbs_up:

We have to persevere, we have to win at the end of the day

Has bitorbit started been constructed by Velas Team and sold after ?
Any better news ?
Wonder just why staking is still continuing giving 20% reward if nothing is up :smiling_face_with_sunglasses::smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
8% more on bitorbit
And 40% more on staking vlx-bitorb on wagyuswap
Hi everyone
Do you have an explnation for getting out of bitorbit ?
If fact, we deserve it right ?

​​Hello, dear community! Take a look at our new Network in Numbers page. The latest update provides you with information on a regular basis, and it's automatic! We’ve also added several new numbers.#VelasInNumbers
Can we ever reach 100$ like solana ???
secret (1065)
Why secret I listened from someone about velas (1066)
If its marketcap reaches 200 billions usd, then yes.... (1065)
Ha ha ha! No one promised vlx how much a piece! But vlx is definitely worth owning for the long haul!
Means not possible even solana doesn't even had this much Market cap at its peak (1068)
Why is velas a hold for the long haul? Whats the devs working on
Why is it here for the long haul? Why wont it fall off like other cryptos in a bear market?
Thanks for the info
No way if vlx reaches 1 dollars only the mc will hit some were around 220 millon (1065)
Everything is possible, 1, 10, 100, 1000 but we need more projects, more people (1074)
There is 50+ upcoming projects in let's see
OK 70+
Haha
I think vlx can do just 100x with this total supply and MC (1075)
Why you think that? (1079)
70+,says months，but no up，is there any news?
I was thinking the same bro
But let's give them time, they know what they are doing.
Let's hope velas is building something huge with roadmap to
Hope
I think it's not the perfect time to reveal the projects
I prefer to wait and see some roadmap
:winking_face:
Yes,hope  more news can hear
Is there roadmap about 70+ projects
They are 70 now but not the same as before, right now there are 65 live from those 70 (1081)
I would like to share a link to velas army page where there is a list of current projects
Thks
Hey hossein those 70 projects that you talking is without nft projects that we already now?
Velas army should fix the graphic of the website
So we have more 70+ I hope no more nft haha

Why not available loan for vlx token on kucoin?
When?this is very long process?I think its not fair for vlx
Кто то слышал что про это?
so I knew
I have contact themI hope vlx can push them too
Is there a document/web page that contains all the projects within the Velas ecosystem?
Great, thanks sir
Is the grant program officially at $250 million now? I see both figures written on different pages. Also the article link on the tweet states this will last for three months, does this mean after the period we'll go back to the $100 million? REGARDLESS, very good to see the direction Velas is going, particularly the deal with Ferrari shows the calibre of partnerships the team is capable of, I am sure it wont be the last. When the bull gets going we'll be hitting new highs
%，*ahnu
Thanks for the reply. So is the $250 million coming at a later date?
As long as the reason you invested is still sound, it's best to keep calm. Patience is absolutely key regardless of the investment.

Never underestimate your power to change yourself!
Just bought Velas a few days ago, this team has a solid project. It's only 0.25% of my portfolio, but I will triple down if they make it to the top 10 marketcap
I also decided to talk about Velas in InvestiShare's latest Podcast, good luck team, good luck investors, I've got an epic feeling about this one
We have a product started in August 2021 and the mvp is going to be launched in this month - June 28th.Our product is a yield product - "The first synthetic farming protocol", where it provides convenience for people to do yield farming while they have full ownership of the funds on their wallet.We are looking to launch on Velas chain as well and would like to build partnership with Velas for collaboration.Who should I contact for partnership discussion?
Can't DM as my account is restricted, could you just add me on your contact?

What are the next step for Vela blockchain to the 2025 horizon
I have seen a website that talks about retro games associated with the Poligon network. I think it's a good idea. I think that Velas could promote something similar, since they are saying in the forums that this is well accepted. Those who play get some rewards as they level up, which are later exchanged for tokens, but that requires them to have a wallet with Poligon, which produces a very interesting call effect.

when binance ..
very good
What do you think the market will be like next week?
anyone there?:thinking_face:
hi i wanna buy VLX
Hello
Why 8s not simple the staking. I have done everything right but no rewards so what should I do
Please how it works the staking because two days ago I staked my tokens but no rewards have been granted
7gGo1uD6hVd4Juv5Tj16DrFKJX1Xq2dndYodb4W6vP9k
So how much time I have wait in order to get the rewards
So I have to withdraw first
But you have to filter the right validators in the list
How can I choose the right one
i don't see the moon ser
For that reason I have chosen the last one because he has 0% commission
But the number of staked was 24M of that validator
I ve got 3 messages from 3 hosseinAccount. Telegram is full of scamers
But in velas wallet you have to filter the valid validator
66tsuTSsZBD4mA7MiBDbYFptuQW8S4NyMgCpgEpxpQjtIt is a validator who gives rewards
Ok thanks
It took how much time to unstable.I have done a request withdrawal

Did velas solved what solana facing again and again? Since velas is a fork of Solana
I am asking about technical issue what solana facing.
I think velas dev will understand what I wanted to know.
The attack can also come for velas in future.
I want to read an article why velas will not face same issue like velas. Because everyone know how dangerous Solana is now.
Could you tell team to make an separate article on it. Because this will let us know how velas is secure and safe.
Hi is the Wallet in android supporting staking? Doesn't load dit me

IT worked, wich validator is best
Is IT oke to choose any validator
I would choose the one with the highest apr
Is that ok
Hello everyone
Is thuis a good one
This
Velas best crypto for next bull run
?
I new in vlx zo font want to do IT wrong
Really? (1442)
For staking the percentage yield can be very high but the yield less productive if the dominance is not low enoughLow ...so it is better to have less apr and more low dominance even if you pay interest to the validator which seems perfectly logical
And how can i unstake
You destake as you stake to know that heap 2 days of beats the time to block or unblock your funds
For first Time I sell some of my available vlx to buy the deep and nothing. I have I don't believe it vlx is strong on this bear market
The vlx is suffering like the others but personally I stick to my plan the more it goes down the more I buy in order to reach my final bag
More we can buy but what can we expect from vlx ......in 2025 guess what will be the price
Those who have money can recharge, those who have less can recharge a little, those who have no money do nothing and wait for the storm to pass...
And above all, don't cry...no one forces anyone to buy cryptos, so if you make a mistake, which I can understand because I too sometimes screw up...well, you don't cry and you lose with a smile...it's only money.

When is a market cap of VELAS now ?
114 milion is very cheap for VELAS
Fill ur bag:OK_hand: (1489)
How many holders has VELAS with all exchange ?
Thanks
Mr. Market's opinion has changed, but we don't give in to reckless emotions.
Thank you
Advice :fire: Don't put VLX or Bitorbit or whathever (two token locked) on Liquidity Providers (LP's). That's what makes exchanges sell part of your token and make cash instead of you. Only stack or hold is better for pricing growing by reducing liquidity available. That's also permit to grow faster then inflationnary system. Read that again.
Not your keys not your coin
Okay thank's
The minute you put collaterals, they sell one of it if the price change up or down for making profit, while just giving you back a percent of this amount in the token that dind't moved.  ExempleYou got in a pool :1K VLX + 1K BITORB in VLX-BITORB LP'sFor that you paid an hypothetic price of $1K + $1K. In total you put 1000 VLX + 1000 BITORB for 2000$Fine.Now the price of VLX goes up 20%.You think you will have 1000$ of VLX + 20% so 1200$ in finally and globally you would have 2200$ at the end.But this is what happend in fact.You get 1200 BITORBIT and 800 VELAS.Which mean you will still have after this +20% on VLX token in finally :- Only 2000$ -That mean that if you just haved hold those two token (VLX & BITORB), or stack it :You would now have at least 2200$ + both stacking reward of the both token.
The market is horrible, I'm too bad
Who is responsible for marketing?
Okay
Velas mooning?
Not yet … but soon :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:) (1502)
Selam
Time to be rich at long time! open your eyes. BUY and HOLD VELAS!
Withdrawal of vlx coins is very fast! But the wallet is slow to load! Wallet needs to be optimized!
2.3.3
:laptop:SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT
Wallet is now the latest version?
ok
One thing the wallet is missing is self check for new version, and/or button in the help menu to "check for updates". If devs can take this into consideration for future releases will be awesome:thumbs_up:
This proposal is scientific! (1511)
Not sure if is backed by science, but i feel maybe needed in future:flexed_biceps: (1512)
Wallet opens and loads slowly!
More advice can accelerate the growth of vlx! (1513)
肯定是兄弟 - For sure my brother (1515)
Advance and retreat together! I wish vlx to enter the top ten soon!
Hey, mates
How can we connect velas wallet to any website like metamask?
why we don't have extension wallet?
Hello
Hello
Hi (1521)
:shamrock:
@Hossein_velas I'm getting a network error when using simplex to buy velasIs there an issue?
This is the error when I select Simplex and click buy
I tried incognito but I am still getting the same error
Just did that, same error
Good afternoon everyone, here I am again
I am getting VLX at $0.07 when VLX is at $0.048
Why is the price so high?
$100/1464=$0.068 per vlx
Simplex used to give me better rates but it is not working Is this for real though? Almost 40% costlier than the actual cost of VLX (1532)
Who can I check with?
I hated using Simplex from the beginning...their fees are high and price not accurate. What i do is get BNB and swap in Pancake Swap. Send the tokens to my Velas wallet and convert to EVM and then Native....and stake them. That was cheapest way. Uf Velas hooks with MoonPay i bet they will give better rates (1533)
Or else gate io releases a good price of the vlx without kyc....just when you send on your wallet velas they don't miss you in the sending costs but gate io is not bad and especially you can buy by placing orders...
I noticed you can stake your evm vlx directly in the wallet now, it does the conversation to native and then stakes automatically (1535)
Should I buy Vlx on the bsc or eth side?
#networks
​​Velas leverages delegated proof of stake as its main consensus algorithm :light_bulb:#DPoS is one of the core features and characteristics of the Velas #blockchain, enabling it to attain unparalleled speed and high transaction throughput.
Hi ! I was just thinking, why is there a maximum of 19 validators ? Does anyone know the answer ?
Indeed there can be much more validators than 19 but I was thinking about the fact that once 19 of them have at least 1M Velas, others will not be rewarded. Where does this limitation come from ? :thinking_face:
The MCAP graph of USDT for this year looks crazy, 10bn wiped off in a month
20k is the electricity cost of mining 1 btc, I have a confirmation now and 32k is the production cost of btc
Why velas need so many people on position?evry month more people...i dont understand...
It’s growing (1545)
Ok but i want to see more dapps and updates...this kind of people spend 1 mil per month for luxos...what u think where they take money :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: (1546)
I think you can trust the velas board for hiring new people, or do you think they dont know what theyre doing?
I dont know man... (1548)

Hello everyone and have a nice day
Hello everyone

Hello, I'm an ambassador at a marketing community. Can you send the your email/Username of CMO/CEO  for contacting them for an AMA proposal  ?
U are marketing manager or u will redirect me to him ?
WagyuSwap is still the main DEX here ?
So vlx have any other official dex?
So WagyuSwap is the only one DEX operating on velas network or there any other ?
Hello guys!! Which would be the best move for buying BTC with BUSD in velas chain?
I’m aware of wagyu swap, but btc is not available just wbtc
Yes, I know. That’s why I’m asking the best (chepest) way to buy BTC with Busd from velas chain.Should I swap it to smart chain and move it to an exchange?
Or there is other way?
We'll all be waiting for the bull market
Adios
hi
:waving_hand:
Hello guys! Can I send Vlx from velas chain to Huobi, and then trade it for usdt and/or BTC?
Hello gate io its ok but huobi i dont know (1568)
Im not admin im holder
But for send on vlx chain i do with gateio
#networks
Huobi only supports vlx on bep-20, so don't sent velas chain vlx there (1568)
Awesone. (1569)
Awesome too
As i have them on wagyuswap
No? Bep-20 isn’t velas chain? (1573)
Gotcha
Bep-20 is binance chain (1577)
If you have them on wagyswap, then you have the vlxevm token, you can sent this to kucoin or bitforex (without needing to convert to vlx native or bep-20 vlx, which will give other cex options apart from the initial 2) (1576)
This is great! Thank you! (1580)
When binance? :man_bowing:
Any news this month?
Or new proyects?
Ok tks
Quickly launch a few projects to stimulate the weak market!
Hello everyone
Hello everyone
On which exchange can I buy BUSD in the VELAS network or tell me the bridge.
Hii
Attending a full day "Digital Innovate Summit" in Singapore's Fullerton Hotel.
Velas Development Team, please speed up the integration of AI. As currently no project in the world have completed any AI integration yet - all are still in development. We will be front runner if we can complete first. More so we are Artificial Intuition - a higher than Artificial Intelligence.
This suggestion is the most concerned issue for all V fans! (1592)
:laptop:SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT
One of the most important. :thumbs_up: (1593)
2nd important is Bitorbit.
Good day everyone!!! Greetings to the success of this project. Who can I contact for AMA proposals pls?
Hi Team , Please note this! (1592)
Hello everyone!

​​Now you can buy $VLX seamlessly and securely from the #VelasWallet via Simplex using a debit card, credit card, or Apple Pay.We’ve also added a button on the website where you can try a new way to buy Velas ($VLX).
Keep going down, there's no hope anyway

Hey guys how long does a epoch take with staking?
Oke thx
Seem that the last Velas F1 sponsorship was nit successful? Simple proof that our tele group or Velas twitter does not increase significantly
Good news. Come on!
@DarkLEOJ check your dm plz!
I can just only imagine how hard was to position brand on Ferrari rear wing and front. All those negotiations for font,size,color, position on the car...just insane. Its not just the money. I am sure Ferrari carefully chooses who they partner with and Velas is not just any pick from the street. Judging by other F1 cars with major crypto sponsors like FTX Crypto ByBit Binance which are huge, Velas is a tiny bit compared to them, but coming bold and fast to compete side by side with the big boys. That I think is a statement. In every marketing campaign the *statement* is the psychological pivot point to attract. Once more value is added to Velas and ready for major T1 exchanges we'll see major upside:flexed_biceps: :rocket:. Till then Velas need to build and improve so demand and utilities doesnt cease prematurely like some projects that already went in the drain. Velas is the underdog...working with governments and i am sure working with banking sector since SEBA bank is one its biggest backers which is also based in Zug. Not a random fact!!!! So just piece it all together to get the big picture and :flexed_biceps::rocket: (1652)
note this :writing_hand: (1655)
I've been noting since December last year when was spending 3-4 hours a night reading about it. Even though i am down a lot because of this market, have no doubt Velas is here to stay :thumbs_up: (1656)
Thanks mate, very acceptable explanation :thumbs_up:
You're welcome! Thats my opinion... everyone has right to make their own, just trying to be objective. Wishing you best and good luck ahead:right-facing_fist::left-facing_fist: (1658)
Accurate analysis! The most important thing is the rapid growth of vlx! (1657)
Similar technologies are changing with each passing day and are updated quickly!
Growing rapid could be dangerous, trees dont grow tall in a month :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: I'd like to see Velas grow sustainable and steady...in my language we have a saying - Rush Slowly :smirking_face: so dont trip and fall. My work philosophy is if we are rushing it means we are doing something wrong. So far for my 17 years of employment never let me down:flexed_biceps::thumbs_up: (1660)
:open_hands: Hi Velas community!We're looking for a community manager for our German speaking community in the DACH region! You should speak English and German and want to be an ambassador of Velas!Reach out our community lead Alex :mobile_phone_with_arrow:@sania_v_poriadke for more info!
V chain ecology grows faster! (1662)
I agree...lot of projects grow faster. What's differs is the approach to solve problems. Velas using something very unique that others dont have. Japanese engineers using the same methods to implement real life solutions in society - Biomimicry and in one of the videos the founder explained it with lab example. (1664)
When binance ?
What happened to that 500% apy?
Wasn't there an exchange who offered 500% apy for staking vlx?
If you often come to share your ideas! The atmosphere in the group will be very active! (1665)
Trying in my free time :smirking_face:...i am back to work and shifts are like 8am to 8pm for the next 6 months...every day...:flexed_biceps:keep strong better days are coming (1669)
Because vlx is "red hot" project (1649)
Are any of them still being sent to the mc do my friend?
Everything are green except vlx......
I was able to read this a little earlier....
We could do an airdrop of promise of work at the mc do....to be listed we would need all these questions....when binance?too much supply..there is no hope anymore it goes down...why the other ones are green and not the vlx?weak project...
And strangely these questions are asked all the time ...but they stay on the telegram velas ....c is beautiful anyway...is it masochism?

I belive that VELAS will be HUGE
Dont believe...be sure:winking_face: (1679)
You are totaly right! (1680)
I don't care if the vlx goes down for months...I fill my bag little by little...basically I equip myself in case of departure on the moon..because once on the moon I prefer to have a nice equipment basically a good vlx bag...than to arrive on the moon with just a thong and flip-flops...
While moving my VLX from an Exchange to the VELAS wallet. Which one should I choose?
:thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up::thumbs_up: (1657)
From gateio to VLX wallet can I transfer via VLX network?
The transfer fees is very expensive.
I know right (1686)
stay real...its 50/50... competition is huge...if you are 100 % sure velas will be huge tell me why you think so? (1680)
Everyday is a new day. :smiling_face_with_heart-eyes:
Tell me why you think not? (1688)
Velas droped from 92 place to 172 place...no bullish news at all...i have not see velas on bigest crypto event consensus 2022 in texas....look at market when eveything pamp we pamp just a bit...im not saying velas is bad im huge supporter.... (1690)
:laptop:SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT
What is the reason for you being a huge supporter? (1691)
Positive people here!
Maybe you are a big fan who wanted to buy a box seat when you only had the budget to pay for a seat next to the public toilets...let velas work and be patient...I have been a fan of great boxers and yet they were not world champions in their first fight...

What to do with tokens TDX on the velas network received after the velaspad. There is no place to sell them, no exchange, and not even a bridge to exchange them for Bep 20. What to do with them, if anyone knows, I was surprised that Velas is so siroi blockchain.
They can't answer either.

Hello Hossein, I have chosen the validator for staking that you have given me. I received the first day a reward but now two days staked I've received non.It 8s normal
Ok thanks
@Hossein_velas does velas have any plans to get added to opensea as a blockchain? Currently only ethereum, polygon, solana and klaytn are available
As expected, bitorbit makes a strong comeback!
That would be amazingVelas would get a ton of exposure
It would drive up the utility of velas
hello
Hello, if one choose to become validator , is there need a 1 milion VLX right? And the return APY how many is ?
And the return in the year?
Thanks …. Last question , wich is a different for validator or easy staking …. The validator because don’t gain more of easy staking ?
Thank you for reply
Where can I submit a job proposal or find out about the ambassador program?
Hello, everyone, I am new here.

hey guys quick question is velas a DPOS or POH, coz i was reading and solana works on POH but when reading velas docs it says its a DPOS
yeah thought so okay thanks
Any dex on velas chain?

OMG! For real?!! Incredible :crossed_fingers:
Guys I think we aren’t in a bear market but a rekt market
As long as velas team has the funds to survive you’re going to be glad we have this bear market opportunity to load up.  And I assume they do have the funds to survive since they still have a grant program (that’d probably be the first thing to go if they needed cash)
I need help
Good news!
Lol.. getting rekt in a bear market imo is the responsibility of anyone (1777)
Did I say something about people’s money? No. Just said no one predicted that mega bear market, everyone expected a simple bear market but no. But we could expect it (inflation, stock crash, Nasdaq crash, Ukraino russian conflict ecc…) crypto followed the trend of the world. (1781)
As long as the reason you invested is still sound, it's best to keep calm. Patience is absolutely key regardless of the investment.
:laptop:SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT
I clame tdx but I don't have any tdx
Patience goes hand in hand with an investment that does not prevent one from living one's usual life...so only managers can remain impassive...as for the others I advise them to run to their kitchen and practice making bigmacs

Whatever the team said was and will always be true. The only problem is many of you don't believe initially. :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: (1776)

Hi when will velas marketplace be ready
only bot and admin like some others coin (1797)
Hello
Why has floor to bridge been changed to 1k
+ which exchange support velas busd (1801)
So why has it been changed to a 1000 minimum to bridge busd
Its a crazy change especially in a bear market for people with less, seems u guys dont seem to care about smaller investors
Feedback question: why would you send your community that uses your own wallet and system to something outside it / unknown - even when they were able to normally use the bridge below 1k? From all blockchains I sure think Velas has very strange steps taken, not thinking from a community customer point of view.
I am sure others think the same as me, wondering and not understanding . ( i want the best for velas, dont get me wrong)
U disagree that is strange?
U disagree that is strange?
Sheesh guys it’s bloody. I wonder if we still sane haha! we are facing an inevitable circumstance we better keep stacking our bags, which is why we must always have a good strategy to maneuver. Hope we be good

Hello guys
Ok I have problem. And it’s my fault. Next time I’ll double check the destination address. I sent some AVO (ERC20 tokens) to my Velas EVM address :0xacaefa03dd1766bf4a7c440f13314c4f21e80a5dI only used this ERC20 address in the Velas walllet app. Is there any way that I can access to this address via Ethereum mainnet ?I have already tried to restore the seed phrase associated with my Velas account via MetaMask. The seed phrase works and allows me to restore my account. But I am connected with a different address. Not the one I have in the Velas App associated with my ERC20 tokens. Please help, :crying_cat:
Exact
Thanks
Hey team witch vlx nft is making vlx?
Thank you :folded_hands:
Apparently I cannot import custom token in the iOS app.
But I did it through the desktop. Very easy and intuitive
Cross chain, inter chain is the future guys
You rock !
100 000 000 of shit coins. But it has a sentimental value. One of my first airdrops ever. Thank you @Hossein_velas :flexed_biceps:
Half the messages here are from bot. Should not be this way
Hey hossein the busd on velas blockchain is bep20 or bep2
?
Tnx
Hey human. Hope there will be less bots
I have the feeling  that we should buy bitorbit
Hey devs I have I have a serious question
If you can answer that
How possibleis for bitorbit to work like Onlyfans??? :thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face: Is there any rules
But is good idea
Let's do the first crypto Onlyfans
On Web3
Using vlx
Burn you velas bro
@SayCobra
Ooomg
:fire::fire:
Yeap I know that I mean someone can't create something similar
Velasfuns
:blue_heart:Vfans
Or Vplay haha
Just make a suggestion to team
Imagine how many people will use vlx
I just promoted Velas, I forced Joe parys to talk about it by sending spam comments. Do I deserve a reward haha?:backhand_index_pointing_right_light_skin_tone::backhand_index_pointing_left_light_skin_tone:
I’m afraid VLX is gonna be one of these altcoins that will not survive the crash :pensive_face:
I became the ambassador of Velas
AHAHAHAH :rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing: good joke (1863)
That’s just the depression mood during this rekt market
Will work better :smiling_face_with_sunglasses: (1847)
I assume since the grant is still being promoted here they’ve got plenty of resources to keep going.That being said if some team members are able to confirm like some numbers of supplies or investment or whatever it might help investor confidence. (1863)
I believe btc is going to 15000 tomorrow
Possible
Vlx Will come Out of this bear Market Like Phoenix Out of the ashes. They can easily survive. Do you think Ferrari and vlx would have done a multi Million Dollar contract for multiple years If they havent bear in mind such situations Like we are facing today? Chill, accumulate. Vlx Will constantly Deliver :thumbs_up: will be top 20 coin and next Run 3-7 Dollars. Longterm 15$+ (1863)
I think that’s possible. It’s a long weekend in USA so harder to get new money in. People may be begging to buy at these prices but won’t be able to until Tuesday (1869)
10
And where VLX is heading…? :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Vlx will follow the btc...
How far do you think Solana might fall?
And solana fallow btcFor the moment btc is the king
Personally, I continue to buy vlx. I don't give a damn if it goes down to 01, at least I believe in this project and I won't let it go.
With mySmall means I buy, I buy and then as long as it does not bother my daily life I do not give a damn:grinning_squinting_face:
Hello
What's the Max Supply of Velas
Okay. Thank you.
So you increase the supply every year?
Can somebody of the team make a graph of the supply for the next 10-15 years ?
@Sylvester_G I have a question. What was the initial price of Velas. ICO or presale price?
Too bad there is a maximum step it's always binding on investors
thanks
0.10 for how many tokens?
:laptop:SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT
The Fed favors the PCE index
I mean a graph in which the y-axis represents the supply and the x-axis the time in years. You understand what i mean?
Something like this.. but this is not precise
But uts a good approximation of the supply
It would be cool if somebody from the developers makes such a scale officially so that people get a better understanding of the supply. Maybe you can make a inquiry to the team. I was just wondering.
But no problem for me if not, inflation is good. Velas cant reach mass use and governmental adoption without inflation.
Same here. But what is your min expectation from velas in terms if adoption and price? (1878)
I want to know from the whales. I am just starting to accumulate
At least 30 Billion market cap in the next bull run 10-15 dollar
Its possible
Based on what? (1898)
Everyone can speculate
But what projects on velas are the reason that it would become top 10
Let's shill it to others too
Its the best chain there is no competition
Ha ok thank bros :thumbs_up:
Word of mouth to your friends and colleagues will not help?
This will come with time
People will know about VLX
Does Velas plan to burn token or just annual injection of tokens?
Thanks mate
What is going on? Lol
I dont get what you want I simply asked some questions
Reported to admins.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
Then why are you still here? (1863)
Team already confirmed multiple times that more than 70 projects in the pipeline. Team also confirmed that they are talking to government, financial and bank on using velas blockchain. What else you think? To me is simple - my immediate question in mind is always "are they even really holding any vlx at all"?. Because real holder won't say this type of damaging comments. (1868)
Link chat ?
is there a way to stake with ledger?
Noob question but is it significant if BTC's market cap falls below USDT's? Is this even possible, if the belief is some of Tether is backed by BTC itself?
Hi, is there developer support for velas?

Can i store other coins like for example Qmall or Bitorbit in my velas wallet?
I tried to manually add qmall and it worked
Also can i bridge qmall from velas chain to bcs chain from inside the wallet?
What price will BTC fall to?
I million (1950)
Market is a little green today but no impact on velas price lol
Anyone have a link to their roadmap ?
We can stake vlx with any amount right ?
Just produces less rewards
Thanks bro

Hello
btw ... that new video on velas youtube is awesome !!:OK_hand::thumbs_up::fire::fire:
​​Don't forget that you’re able to use $VLX on Travala.com for over 3 million products and services. Use your #VLX on hotels, events, flights and more :airplane:Where would you fly using $VLX?
Good morning. Does Velas have any stake in Travala or it’s just a commercial partnership?
Thank you for the update! It will be great to see more of such partnerships that increase the utility of VLX. We’ll done! :thumbs_up:
Consuming vlx now is a waste!
When the presidential suite is worth a vlx, we will consider consumption!:victory_hand:
It depends on the level of entry :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes: But I agree with you, that it’s worth holding VLX for long-term (1977)

Hi guys, I  once transferred usdt from the velas network on metamask to my account on binance, the funds left the account but I never received them on binance. The transaction shows on the block chain. I tried binance support, it was unsuccessful. Does anyone know how I can get the funds back? Please help!
Does binance accept vrc-20 usdt deposits? I didn't think so, you'd have to bridge from velas to bcs 1st I would have thought (2007)
I don't remember the network I selected on binance. I was new to crypto.
hi guys, when binance? (2004)
I think that usdt is gone then man, as binance definitely doesn't support vrc-20 usdt (which is what it would have been in your metamask wallet on the velas network) (2009)
Thanks for the information. Now I know. :loudly_crying_face::loudly_crying_face: (2011)
Sorry man, hopefully it wasn't a lot and hopefully they add the velas chain usdt, then as @Hossein_velas says, you'll be able to see it :crossed_fingers_medium-light_skin_tone::crossed_fingers_medium-light_skin_tone: (2012)

Sir, please integrate so many coins in velas wallet (2079)
Oops, I'm sorry
:face_with_tears_of_joy: (2087)
If you expect it to go to zero when you bought it at 0.06 you must be a great mathematician ...and yet I bought it at all levels ...so whether it goes to zero or stays at 0.04 for 2 years doesn't bother meMore than that :winking_face: I can't wait to see you writing on this wall again since you are already asking for the exchange list where velas could be a candidate.
And hello hossein stenay and all the clique of holders!!!
When massive adoption come to Velas, is it possible it experiences issues such Solana network did?
Asking as velas is a solana’s fork
Where can I inform myself about velas network features?
Awesome. Will read WP and come back to you with questions :). For instance, for what do EVM stand for?
Etherum virtual machine
Just checked. Seems I have a lot to study today
Right! :winking_face: (2095)
It's not the same type of fork as many think so. (2097)
Build a CEX VELAS, like Binance CEX, like KuKOIN CEX, like WX CEX, this Will be huge for token utility
What about bitorbit? That group is dead
Since I do not know English well, I chatted with the help of an interpreter. Because of this, the translation did not convey the meaning correctly. I meant that I am waiting for my 30000vlx to become $2000 again and immediately sell and not tempt fate.:winking_face: (2094)

Hello, I would like to know the Max supply ? Thanks
Weird System but why not :grinning_face_with_sweat: there are currently almost 2.3B circulation token ?
As a smart contract writer, I will be helpful for your project. (2144)
Ok thanks. So if i understand, if there isnt a max supply and then circulation supply increases years after years, the price will goes down automaticaly..
Inflation yes but they have a Max supply
Dev just a suggestion please join itoken wallet
Can anyone answer how velas is going to deal with this ? (2152)
Yes it means the price will goes down years after years..
We have a max supply
Basic VLX metrics: • Total supply - 2,229,737,314 VLX; • Circulating Supply - 2,223,461,795 VLX; • Inflation rate - 8%;
How would that translate to price ? More tokens lower price especially if tokens are being printed
You are very right sir
Thank u for giving me some insight
Not neccessary. (2151)
There is a limit in new token at 1.5%. When mass adoption take place. This 1.5% increase don't even enough to cover the mass increase in use case. (2158)
Those argue price with sure decrease with inflation because they never see increase in use case. Good project will never stop in developing new feature and new use case. Simple! (2162)
3 years in velas and no use 4 the coin yet (2163)
i hope burn some vlx soon or big project can use vlx
hey guys! i want to transfer from velas legacy to velas native, but in a wallet it is not working, black screen and it shows that page is loading. Any problem with the wallet?

velas ain’t reliable to solana, right?
solana is being manipulated as what i’ve read and heard
?
well it seems apparently that a whale wants to liquidate solana. bringing it to 0
In the current market, it is easier to fall than rise
It’s easier to be a bot than a human too (2202)
Maybe you're right
good

everyone says the same about their own project. if there’s gonna be a liquidation then there’s a problem with the project itself. (2206)
Users being over leveraged and getting liquidated isn’t a problem with the project, it’s an issue with the user. (2216)

Frankly I am not creative enough to make velas progress..the wallet has progressed well.the security level is top and the transactions are fast.there is nothing to say about velas..all that is missing is that velas welcomes good projects and velas will be esteemed among the best blockchains in the world.Best blockchains
Everything comes to those who wait...the patient man is often rewarded
Personally myfinances for velas do not handicap me in my daily life...two options if velas goes to the moon I have had time to equip myself so that I don't catch a cold once up there...if velas goes down again I grab my banker by the hair for his sake and force him to bet on vlx with me.If velas goes down again I grab my banker by the hair for his sake and force him to bet on velas with me...he will thank me in a few years

From Canada few days ago
Mobile wallet still lagging (2321)
Its true (2327)
I think they are also working on the mobile wallet
In any case, on the whole, the team has done its job perfectly...now it's time to correct the details...and as I said above, Velas has nothing to be ashamed of...we are at a stage where we have to wait to see projects perform on this blockchain.
70 + project
So since velas has good logistics we just have to wait patiently for developers with productive project ideas to come back to velas because if vlx allows to pay transaction fees but also allows to swap on tokens that become useful we will have won

Hello everyone

Too many stupid scammers :grinning_face_with_sweat:
Hello guys!!
And havent received yet
I will get the?
Ok
Should i contact you?
Or not?
The issue is that I just transfer vlx from metamast to Gate. Exchange. And have not received them
It was from vlx network to bsc/bep20
I will get them or burn them?
Well I transfered because it was said by you or at least in this group that gate supports those transfers/networks
This is inaccurate
The option for transferring velas native in gate. Is NOT supported.
The option is not on website
Please be careful in the information you provide
I sent it because it was mentioned on an official channel, but just burnt vlx because of you
Hello guys
Unfortunately unable to send pictures here
how is it going mate
Metamask supports vlx-bep20 if on the bsc network, vlxevm(not native) if on the velas network and erc20 vlx if on eth network)..... You can't send native vlx from metamask (2432)
@zenshiriu_san , you must have sent vlxevm to gate from metamask, this isn't supported by Gate (2444)
hey man
who is the marketer around?
ok thanks
Hello, I wish you a good mood every day

When on binance?
Ok thx
Interesting... So what's to stop Velas minting loads and dilute my bag too worthless?
Say like what happens with Tera
Thanks il have a read
But it was it not the validators of Tera that let the mining keep going till it was worth less the they decided to stop it when it was too late
Hello
Brilliant thanks for you time I appreciate it and now have a better understanding I will do my own research from now :raised_fist_light_skin_tone:
I'm definitely getting a bag just not sure of the size yet lol

What's the main Velas coin
So Meany
twitter suspended bitorbit and now verve ? Why
So I can stake lol
Wallet should support bitorbit token deposit!
It's best to just buy VLX Native from the start I guess than
Nice one thanks
twitter suspended bitorbit and now verve ? Why
I'll try.
I lose faith in velas and all bluezilla projects, it's not normal for twitter to suspend accounts like this, it looks like a scam
No info from verve
I want to know the reason why twitter has suspended bitorbit and verve
I don't have a search bar.
all right
Perfect
Yes
twitter suspends bluezilla projects because it breaks rules and velas advertises these projects, it would be nice to be honest and tell us why, otherwise there's more trust
so in your opinion bluezilla projects are scams?
you say you are not bluezilla partners, but velas do news for bitorbit, twitter suspended bitorbit account because of illegal activity, you encourage people to invest in projects and you don't know that is it a scam or not
so bitorbit is not a bluezilla project? Or do you support projects of which you are not partners?:face_with_raised_eyebrow:

How much does the inflation drop per year
is 6.99 considered high as an inflation rate?
Staking elevates the effect of inflation
Good morning, everyone.
True ? (2571)
:hundred_points:
What has this got to do in elevating the effect of inflation? :thinking_face:
Hello friends
Maybe staking increases the number of tokens in circulation...so it increases the number of tokens in circulation so it can play on the drop of the token...am I wrong?
But asThe velas network is in proof of stake the validators must necessarily be rewarded so velas must necessarily work like this I am wrong?
You can't haveeverything...i.e. staking rewards but no supply...a project that grows but gets to the moon immediately...and especially given the current world situation....so those who don't haveGo get drunk and turn off your phones hang a poster of binance and suffer in silence...or cut your fingers to avoid writing negative things we all know
Hello thereeeee

On velas wallet is there a way to recover the seed phrase?
I saw that article but it doest show how to see your seed phrase again. Like meta mask allows you to see it again.
I have access to the account.
Ok. I will do that. There is no way if you are logged in to recover on the mobile app right?
I habe finger print access.. no issues right now.. i wanted to add the web wallet since i have mobile app
But to add the web wallet i need the seed phrases
Thanks guys.. i might jusr get another wallet and transfer funds..
Man scammers are plenty on this chat lol.. popping like pop corn to offer "help"
Done..
Thanks for the help... packing my bags on this bear market
Perhaps something for the development team to look into it. To add access to your seed phrases on mobile app like meta mask does.
If you can log in fine dont see why not have your seed phrase available
Thanks again!
Sure. Or even better allow qr code scanning to add web wallet or desktop from the mobile app. It will make it easier to go from one platform to another at ease

:grinning_face_with_sweat::grinning_face_with_sweat:
As well as having the options given already, you can bridge your bsc busd over to velas network (in the veleas wallet or via swapz website (BnB needed for both, but velas wallet is cheaper)) and then buy vlx on wagyuswap also, then send to your velas wallet and stake (the wallet now converts to native vlx automatically during the staking process) (2660)

You said increasing 8%, how it reduced by 15%?
I didn't understood bro
This is not understandable to me (2727)
So let us say, if there are 100 tokens in 2022,then it will increase by 108 in 2023(8% inflation) and reduced by 91.8 tokens in 2023? Isn't it?
Bro?, 15% reduction?
Hi sir.How to stake?

Hi.. bought vlx on kucoin..can i send the token to an erc20 or bsc wallet? Or do we need dedicated velas wallet?
Ok..even if i dont want to stake i need native wallet?
Is there a way to see how much tokens are really still in circulation? As I think a lot of tokens are already lost, stuck and sent to unexisting adresses (binance for example)
Can you give an example of non circulating supply??
Where can stake?
Was this recorded or anything?
Just says the event has ended, can't see anywhere where I can watch a recording or anything (unless it'll be uploaded later or something)

Why not ??this end of the world for you because the market go down sincerely? (2814)
It is better for the CEO to tell us good news about the idea and the program every day, so that we can be encouraged and confident in investing in the project. In this crypto market, one day is one day and it may take months to replace it one day!
Your word will be advertised, but little by little, the news of cooperation with some big projects should be on the agenda to appear for sale and purchase, turn to other channels.  Every day news of a new project is announced!  We do not regret it, I have full confidence in the China Wallace block, I'm just worried that many projects have no place in crypto. But some have ح sponsors! But I'm more sure why they do not list two big exchanges?  It is China that fears its future, which is no longer popular in the crypto market
What’s the staking apr %?
The best, most faithful, fastest and lowest paid Chinese blockchain in the world, but I wonder why they do not list in the big two exchange offices? Are they worried about the future of their own blockchain? Or are they afraid of Wallace's power?
how to stake?
It is also possible to stake in Metamusk wallet?
Thank you for your kindness

I have already tried this bridge it tells me max transfer 0.02 busd  he doesn't want me to send the 46$
my problem is that I don't have $1000
Why I can not withdraw the amount I want the blockchain velas and not like other blockchain I can not withdraw the amount I want it means that the $ 46 are lost for life?

I still think we haven’t seen the lowest low yet

:laptop:SOCIAL MEDIA ACCOUNT
How to invest in this coin?
good afternoon
Hi there
Salaam
Were can I find  my coins once I unstake
I did it 3 days back
@Hossein_velas i have question. Could i dm you
​​Meet our COO Shirly Valge at the Investment Festival 2022.:watch:When: 1-3 July, 2022:pushpin:Topic: "Where to find value? How to spot the scams? How to build passive income? Hottest trends”You can find a link to the festival program and waiting list here.
Good day how are you? I am starting to see this project and I have a doubt, CMC says that there is a supply of 2.32B but looking at the contracts of the ETH and BNB networks I see approx 100 million in each one, what do I need to see to find that 2.1 billion missing token?
And why is this contract not loaded in CMC? or is there no contract for VLX on your Mainnet?
Thx
Admin, he is lying (2904)
Btc will dump more, velas is not an exception, isn't it
Yes, instead of saying like this, he said this is the lowest point for velas

Hye
I haven't looked at my portfolio in a while
Well,go on:winking_face: (2954)
Hello…. How many years is the partnership with Ferrari ?
Basically he asks how many years the partnership with ferrari is signed for
Is it a contract for 1 season or is it a contract for an indefinite period of time
Yes exactly (2958)
I mean this @Sylvester_G
I think he will find it hard to answer not because he doesn't want to but because he doesn't know I think these contracts are confidential between ferrari and the top management of velas
Ok thanks for the reply
You've been a holder for a long timeMarco?
Ferrari site :L’accordo pluriennale prevede la creazione di contenuti digitali esclusivi per i fans della Scuderia. Inoltre, Velas sarà Title Sponsor della Ferrari Esports Series, la serie monomarca on line del Cavallino Rampante, e del team di Esports che competerà nella F1 Esports Series, il campionato ufficiale digitale cui partecipano tutti i team iscritti al FIA Formula 1 World Championship.
Pluriennale mean more years
So minimum Is 2 years (2965)
Yes my friend …. I buy everyday (2963)
I am not trying to reassure you because only the market is the boss on board but hold on, I too have doubts sometimes but I continue the dca to the extent of myMeans of course
Velas has taken the best assets of the best blockchains...the competition is tough but in the very long term I am sure that this project will take off, at least that's my conviction
I don’t have a dubt…. I like see the logo VELAS in Ferrari F1, and is a important partnership …Ferrari know every one in the world and is for VELAS a big opportunity for have a visibility
It's very true what you say velas needs chises now to complete its final structure: a good visibility of the general public to make itself known and need developers with ingenious ideas
Yes I’m agree with this (2971)
Anyway, have a good eveningDudes and good luck for the holders
Thanks you too :smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes: (2973)
Do you think I'm lying? That's the real value you and I see in the VLX! (2920)
The current price of vlx is far from its value!
It's just a matter of time!
What's the ath ?
Mc I mean
VLX network should advertise more than it is, it should give more of the partnership with big companies to their crypto world, in this market of fear and hopelessness, positive news is very effective. Any good news these days can be very beneficial for us. I wish the news of partnership with big companies in the network program  The market is very hungry for positive news (2956)
The VLX network is very well promoting the programs. But I don't know why the two big exchanges have no desire to be listed? Maybe the reason is that the iPhone doesn't want to pave the way for Samsung!!! The two big exchanges that we all know are very influential.  I am sure they are worried about the ideas and programs of our company (VLX), because we are strong and we will become more. Hoping for better days. (2970)
Definitely yes (2975)
Hello

Thanks
Hi once again, We want to built a dapp on Velas, do you have a trusted community of developers or software engineers that can  help us built it?
:dollar_banknote::dollar_banknote::dollar_banknote::dollar_banknote::dollar_banknote:
velas could reach 20-30ct at the end of the year i think
And we thought it was the bottom at the time :grinning_face_with_sweat:
The mobile wallet is slow to load! Too slow to have confidence!
Other wallets are opened quickly without loading! What's the reason?
I operate on the mobile phone, the network wallet can be faster, but I like to use the mobile wallet, I hope the V team can optimize the mobile wallet, open and load the silky instant can be used!
I'm in a hurry! Thank you for your hard work!
Wallet works perfect over here (3013)
New daily!! Hope its a green day today!
Slow motion collapse continues, probably floor fall out soon and 18k coming up
