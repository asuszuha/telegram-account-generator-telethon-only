Hi! With whom we can discuss the integration with exchanges??
Hello everyone
Good morning velas
I am waiting for.... I hope :rocket::rocket::rocket::rocket:
:four_leaf_clover:
Helo boyz will be velas on Consensus2022 crypto festival?
Ok tnx..its biggest festival in crypto from 9-12 june :)
hi
Kind reminder to all our friends out there - if anyone contacts you that is support and ask you to verify wallet and connect to some dodgy website is a 10000% SCAM!!! :grinning_face_with_sweat: Never connect your wallets and give the pleasure to those fucking scammers to drain your funds and steal your passphrase. WATCH OUT!!!
BTW i love wasting their time :face_with_tears_of_joy::thumbs_up: now that i am poor and jobless is the best entertainment i can have :OK_hand::grinning_face_with_big_eyes:
According to the events of the last few days, listing on Binance will have a negligible effect on the price of VLX.  We have to look for powerful adaptations and the best possible projects on the Velas network !! :crossed_fingers::beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Happy New Year
:face_with_tears_of_joy: (26)
I always knew that we all have a different view of space time...to wish me a happy new year on June 1st you feel it is someone different...
:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
I think my friend sophia is still in bull market:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:
When I see the difference with etherum's fees...and here I saw that they are trying to lower bnb's fees too.... are they afraid of the competition?
Velas should be at least around 50 cent with all the solutions they offer. :face_with_tears_of_joy: (31)
:fire::index_pointing_up:
Better for us, buy more guys (32)
And yes my friend...but let's be patient and accumulate ....ojective minimum 100k of vlx before it starts....ca there I have all the scammers coming to contact me when they will see 100k:rolling_on_the_floor_laughing::rolling_on_the_floor_laughing:
100k are so much much but it the perfect amount :man_tipping_hand_medium_skin_tone:
Sure!! (34)

Hello everyone
Hello, this information is outdated, these stakings in BW and Probit no longer exist.
is this token dead or active
I see Solana having issues again :man_shrugging:
Velas need to take over from them asap :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
When Velas to 1€?
True, but we're better, so would be good to take their market share :money-mouth_face::money-mouth_face:
Good night
Hello bogdanovThey bought solana.Oki dump it
Good night
good start
guys what do you think about the project Arabic cash?
Hello
Hello
Who is ready for BTC at 22k ? :rocket:
Nobody (62)
22k or 6000usdt here is velas:winking_face:
Solana they have a headache....
I have headache with them....just took some pills after seing the charts :see-no-evil_monkey: anyway i am not selling. Sticking to the plan is the hardest part to success (65)
Unfortunately for them and othersblockchain is a kind of chance for velas to observe the mistakes of others in order to avoid this kind of inconvenience on its own blockchain...morality..keep filling your bag with vlx!
You read my mind. Velas watching from sidelines for the github repos to be updated and taking the good without experiencing the bad. By the time Solana Beta switch to Mainnet stable 1.0 Velas will be in poll position for the race :thumbs_up: (67)
Everyone is affected by the drop, but solana bugs severely.... and these are mistakes that velas will try not to make
In short, all that remains is for me to put my purchase orders in place...good evening to all
Pills take effect on me too...shot of wisky and turning the lights off. Good night everyone (GMT +3):flexed_biceps:
Hello everyone
VLX Eat them ALL
VELAS has the time and the opportunity to see and avoid some issues that Some Others are doing!!! at the same time, VLX can take their place, SO people, talk about us, Buy, Hold, Stake and again, repeat, BUY, HOLD, Stake and talk about VLX
VLX talking!
WE are Here!
Agreed. Wondering did solana team reach out to velas team for help. :thinking_face:
Any admin here, can I send screenshot?
Vlx is fork of salona how if salona s few project get shifted to vlx is there is any chance  happening in future
I really hope, because it is a very Bad news the solana bug
Good Morning Velas
Buy vlx, pump is coming
2 year
The sol outage and Luna crash may be a good opportunity for vlx to increase its ecology!
n hao
Because the money come in. Now all money come out
The whale
Did Velas successfully get some projects from LUNA following its crash? (84)
Are we reaching out to Solana devs? Their network is also crashing
Any news bitorbit?
Hi :waving_hand:
salam dadash khuby ye sual dashtam manzur az staking chie ?
mumkene pul az dast bere ?
This week is boring
Nothing new
​​Now you can buy $VLX seamlessly and securely from the #VelasWallet via Simplex using a debit card, credit card, or Apple Pay.We’ve also added a button on the website where you can try a new way to buy Velas ($VLX).
I think it will be lateral for a long moment (94)
Haha
Non hossein quieter than that
At least no one's crying...like..why does it dump?what happens to velas?when binance?too much supply?
Comunity indonesia ?
Am I allowed to call myself velas on call off duty or do I risk a lawsuit?
Ok:smirking_face:
Hello, I sent VLX from my Velas EVM wallet on Metamask to Gate io using ETH address on Gate. I can see the transferred balance on evmexplorer velas com website when I check the receiving wallet address, but not reflected to Gate balance yet. Did I fail to transfer the funds and make something wrong?
So there will no more be Bluezilla backed projects launched on velaspad?
Hi guys, after a bit of help please.looking at buying Velas.  but a bit confused i thought velas, was a solana fork,  but it seems if i buy it, i am buying it on ethereum ?is that right ?  i thought it would be on solana ?
Thankyou,  so its not on solana ?  is that right ?
cheers, so you can buy on bsc also ?  ie to save on gas fee's?
It seems like more people have velas on BSC then ETH.   would BSC be better ?   cheers for your answers mate
ok cheers, so how do i buy it on the velas blockchain ?  for example if i buy it on pancake swap, isnt that on/using ethereum ?
Ok, thankyou.  So how do you recommend i buy velas on  bsc or eth or eth ?there is 46,959 addresses on bsc,   and only   2400 on etherscan.so seems like more people buy on bsc.is there any issues with buying on bsc,  can i still stake etc, if i buy on bsc.sorry for the million questiosn
Poocoin:face_with_tears_of_joy:
thankyou, but i dont want to use fiat.basically, just trying to confirm if the following is correct.1.  bsc seems to be the more popular chain to buy Velas on ?   yes/ no ?2.  Can you stake velas bought on bsc in the velas wallet ?  yes/no ?cheers
But Velas team must be sure that we do not have the same Bug (54)
Sad, they bring a lot of good projects with many x-es.
Cheers mate, so when you say most liquidity is in the native token,  that is the ethereum address right ?  but that only has 2400 accounts on it
And Velaspad is their official launchpad?
So just watched that video,  if i buy velas on the bsc chain, can i change it to velas native on that wallet ? (116)
Nothing about Velaspad in that article
awesome,  thankyou
Ah, so it's an independent launchpad, not a part of official Velas products.
What is the current apy for staking ?
Thanks!
When launched, vlx absolutely explodes!
Thanks.
When listing on binance?
Will we get to Binance?
really
When
Hello everyone
Will list after the day announcement is make. (129)
That is known, it seems that if it is certain that we will reach Binance if not it is not said in public here (131)
I agree with you (132)
No
Wait
Buy more
We have to go more down
Because I have to buy. More :face_with_tears_of_joy:
Please wait for binance

No, btc still have to spread some blood. On leveraged positions
Of course. (132)
You can buy now. (137)
No

Btc is still dropping :relieved_face::relieved_face:
Hello everyone
No wonder it down. All because of this mindset (147)
We are not il bull market you know?
The contrary
Scam (149)
Can still be stable even in bear market if community have strong positive mindset.
If BINANCE arrives it will explode
Opinion are not money bro
x3 at least
Price will grow if the market cap grow (155)
Not really in this situation (155)
Are you newbie?
Check out those newly listed on binance how they perform.
You? (160)
Not you
I mean enrique
Those who think listed on binance sure pump are still in old good time.
Is not time for being rag pulled
I'm not a beginner but you're going to ask a beginner question, do you think VLX reaches 1 dollar after listing on binance? I know it's possible, but I would like to know if it's PROBABLE
Best option now is hold
You don’t lose if you don’t sell (168)
Market cap growPrice grow (167)
Of course (170)
Btc is not that bearish guys
Retailers
My opinion is always same and consistent - yes only when market is "really" in stable. Not those saw 1 or 2 days increase and called it recovered. (167)
I fully agreed and believed.
Its clear where the journey is going, stay positive and patient!
Velas is something totally new, nobody knows the project, the majority of the people that know velas just dont really understand the chain and its benefits.
If btc really bearish. Market is double bearish. Whether you like it or not: when btc down every 1% market down 2-5x. When btc up 1% market not necesary up or max up 0.25-0.50%. (172)
I see elon musk posting about velas in 5 years
Or something crazy like that
Velas is still very small
Hello everyone
Right. Time to sleep. Is 1.15am here. Stay positive. :thumbs_up: (177)
Good night steney :thumbs_up:
Help
Thanks. :thumbs_up: (184)
Absolutely not, the contrary
And I can't advice any coin
Dyor
Bro if btc pump, then the other coins will pumpIf btc dump, then all the market will go down
hi
any list of new dapps coming to velas ?
any idea when the oracles are coming to velas?
Thank you. I was under the impression that one or two oracles would be on velas soon
Yes, people are hoping tidex can do the same as Qmall and getting into vlxpad
Good luck (195)
Tidex, just a new Ido launching on vlxpad(plus some of their other pads), it's an exchange I believe, not looked into it much to be honest
Tindex...sounds like tinder:face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy: it must be a crypto for libertine swingers
This is the space to ask about VelasSloth project?
Is this*
Good night, everyone
Yes. Vlx is listed there as well. Not an official listing. They listed vlx themselves. (197)
Hello everyone
Since VLX is based on SOL, when SOL goes down does VLX go down aswell?
Is the team public?
Good to know. Is the team public?
Where can I read about them? Didnt see it on About Us on the website.
What's the maximum token supply, and unlock schedule?
Thank you. What is the maximum token supply?
:waving_hand::waving_hand:

What’s the APY on staking and what platform can I stake on
thanks
Pls where can I stake
Two questions: 1. Is there any project been built on this network at the moment and how many 2. Is this network on Mainnet yet ?
Are you looking to reduce velas supply?
Ok
What is the max supply currently
And what is the current MC
do you have list of projects being built?
Is this correct?
Yes

why is wag bad ?? (233)
i guess your answer fits more the comment of the other guy :smiling_face_with_sunglasses:))
Hello!New here
I have a question.  How can I stake Velas in Trust Wallet?
Hello! :waving_hand::slightly_smiling_face:
anybody familiar with velas blockchain mechanics here?
I have a question , As forked from Soalna, does Velas still utilise Proof of history? are Blockchain entries, timestamped from central source?
adn I have been messaged by 'mod' to join a large group where people are asking for wallet addresses, that is a scam?
Wow you have people callignto scam as well?
worst experience joining a group ever
yoru mods need to do soemthing better
no admin or mod should EVER contact first.
Perfect
So we are considering moving our project to velas then.
Yes i know this others may not
Sol up time has been a worry and finding competent rust devs has also been challenging.
Being able to work in Solidity will make it much easier and faster to roll out
What exchanges is Velas available on?
ah all eth. dexes
Any plans to have FTm or AVax bridging?
I love this.
Our project is a real world to Defi NFT property Bond market,am I allowed to link in here?
Hello
www.meta-fin.tech
oh i am not allowed to link lol
well its meta-fin and then dot tech. We were working of Solana, but if Velas DOES work with POH as well. I think we should pivot.
Thanks for the help, will discuss with team.
Gm ppl
Can I buy this in pancake swap?
Agree need new defi… good team… wag bad management of supply (233)
Should have a glance at what we are building. (271)
Need independent dex…. Quality dex
Wasnt in our original scope and could hinder us, but an algo stable with NFT property bonds is what we are building full real world marketplace utility.
We did want to build a profit optimisation autocompounder and insurance pools
But we will need competent dexes to create lps from.
Now lots of people have eyes on velas because of solana outage. If they can really pull out it would go crazy in the coming months
exactly why i am here
are there velas wrapped analogues of eth tokens?
so WFTM for eg that works on velas chain, nobody wants to faff about with too much bridging and fee leakages
I love this project next few years it will boom
hmm why nothing for a month, and 41 addresses.. very low.. Maybe too early.
Agree 100% no trust BZ project… all down below ido price… red flag (276)
Take a look at wagyuswap !!:OK_hand: nr.1 dex on Velas ;) (276)
when is pamp?:crying_face:
Buy a pump and you got it.
Contact me in PM for help!
Pamp soon...bull cross on 3 days MACD (285)
why did we fork with SOL? What happend?
why dont we have a limited supply? it means we have unlimited supply, not written in the white paper, why didnt you make it limited?
is there burning of coins?
thanks for all the answers
Oh.  Thats not so exciting..
Today it feels like a day of questions and blame...put on your bulletproof vest hossein....ca is going to pumper in the blame....too much supply, when binance, what do we do with solana??why does it dump? Good luck to the Velas team!
Something interesting i was researching today...SOL is backed by some big VC and the biggest supporter of Solana is FTX. Now to extrapolate what means that for Velas (btw my own personal opinion)- Ensures long term development and code integration- Solid market- Expanding utility in various sectors- Growing community- Seamless bridging Overal recent downtime of Solana did not worry me at all. It just reminded me the early days of Cisco when they were facing all issues releasing their iOS for switches and WAPs and their firewalls. Took time, but Cisco is now globally respected brand for industrial scale network setups - reliable and fast
With a little time and patience I made myself a little bag of vlx, I think that one day it will start and we will laugh about all these questions and reproaches :victory_hand:
So BNB is backed by Binance, SOL is backed by FTX, Coinbase is with USDC so in other words the biggest exchanges in the world are leading force behind the biggest projects in the crypto space. Thus why i am so bulish for Velas as they get listed on more and more exchanges
Most L1 inflation for validator rewards
I always like to give a comparison with Snadbox and Velas...anyone interested just check on circulating supply for both to see the difference. Sandbox wont recover...just pumped and dumped and still has lot of coins not in circulation and what actual utility it provides?? Velas has almost all their tokens in circulation. Realistically speaking VLX should be in range of 70c to $1 and even that is still undervalued at the moment. But it will come soon:flexed_biceps::thumbs_up: (296)
if supply is infinite this analysis is incorrect. (299)
any inflation at all is a completely unworkable paradigm
IF we want somethign to go down in value over time, we have fiat
Really disappointed at this.
and for that reason. Im out.
Contact me in PM for help!

Hi guys? What is happening with Bitorbit? We don't have any news fir ages and this is a Velas core team official project.The twitter account is suspended and everything about this looks abandoned
Perfect. So it will restart then and not abandoned
Anyone looking forward to buying more and anticipating a further dump in price of vlx???

happy weekend
Great!
What partnership we have? It's a game on velas or more chains?
OK thanks
has anyone had any issues claiming BMF tokens from the highest private velaspad tier??
Does vlx have discord ?
Thx
Quick question for anyone… how can safecoin and vlx basically be forks ofSolana but be launched beforeSolana was launched ?
Or am I confused lol
When was Solana launched ? On cg it says around 2020 but vlx is 2019
That has to be wrong right
Hello everyone
What about Solana ?
Straw hat as well? (330)
Ahahaha
Yeah bro
Ooooo ok I understand now
Yeah just found out about it today on twitter.. with a comment saying it’s a Solana fork but I now know it is not
Why
hi guy is this solana fork ?    is this beta version like solana?
Help
:waving_hand:
:waving_hand:
Soon enough
Go go go team!!:fire::fire::mechanical_arm:
Hello
Buy tax??
As velas is a fork of solana, is it prone to same issues?
Mainly trading spot orders not executed faster
Great. Then, it is a matter of time when people will know about it
Anywhere we can stake velas?
Do you have an announcement channel. Thanks
Good morning

Hey guys, I just started to stake a few days ago on the Ferrari validator but it now says "inactive" next to it, what does it mean ? is it because the node is down at the moment ?
Thanks, would you recommend to wait a bit or to unstake and stake on another node ?
Hi, yesterday I finally swapped my BEP20 VLX to Native and put it into Staking :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:Have read through the warmup and cooldown, but unfortunately do not quite get it. Now 25% is added per epoch until 100% is reached and then the whole thing again when paying out. Is that correct so far? How long does an epoch last and when do my VLX start earning rewards when I put them in last night?
Hi xavier even if the validator fees are higher when you are on your wallet select the validators with the lowest and highest dominance...
Then you do as you like, of course, but that's what I did.
Perfekt thank you :beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:
Hi to all the positive team of velas !!!!ca is not crying too much today?bitorbit ,supply,the project is weak,when binance,a new dex?why this dump...
If the project takes off we should make kleenex velas...
hello
They are on vacation. :face_with_tears_of_joy: (370)
I would like to build it velas
Am I good to go with that?
Woah thank you
haha
what do you think about wagyuswap and astroswap ?
hello guys I have a question if sol down; would That affect vlx?
We are not Solana (379)
Solana is a young protocol fomed
Hello everyone, have you had a great weekend?
Breathe. Relax. Focus on something that makes your day brighter.
Our price not depend from Solana
No (384)
What happened to velaspad?
Thanks. Is there a list of projects built on velas?
Hey anybody home
Hey so I have been in the community for a while and I was thinking of creating an NFT collection ( it will be free mint - meaning users won't have to pay to mint it  ). But am not sure how to go about it( I have the art traits & design ready ). I don't know if I should submit some form of verification or not. So just let me know.
Do I have to submit a verification even though if a free to mint or should I just deploy it and submit the website so users can claim their NFT from the blockchain
The reason for asking is I haven't seen anyone here launching a project talking about a project. That why am asking
The use and the adoption make the price
Someone should create nft monsters with the ability to breed, spending vlx (90% burn)
Hello! For transferring Vlx from metamask (velas network) to velas wallet. I should direct it to velas native right?
:eyes::fire::smiling_face_with_sunglasses: (363)
Ok. And staking on native?
Thank you man!
Hi
I am not bot
Please adm I want a group spanish language or frensh

Thank you
i need the token address. Already have the network added
yea. sorry

Ok so here's what i'm struggling with. I bought VLX via swapz but it's not showing in my wallet. I've added the token contract to the ETH chain and BSC chain but nothing showing up. I'm thinking that because it should show up in my Velas network, am i right?
I mean.. I think bought VLX. Maybe I just swapped my busd to Velas BUSD. (421)
I converted BUSD on the swapz platform
So Binance
So yeah, seems like you've just converted your binnace busd to busd on velas (423)
Just use wagyuswap to buy vlx with that busd (if it's vlx your after).
It worked! @Sylvester_G helped me out
Hi  thereI can get you upvote and stars on CoinGecko, CMCTrending coingecko and crypto comList cg & cmc And we have High speed in finishingwho can I dm to make a deal?

Hello
How to count rewards staking on velas wallet?
This is great!
hey everybody
Why the price continue dropping? Is there minting function or what?
Who is selling, I wonder? I continue buying from 0,5 till 0,07
But is the dump even any close to the end?
@Sylvester_G Can you check dm?
What kind of a hit, I wonder? And is Velas so tightly connected with a sol?
Thanks for feedback! Volume 436 - is it high or low? Is it an all exchanges or some?
Do you think Viet Nam is a very potential market? CZ have just come to Viet Nam to join their Blockchain conference.
And their government is forming a Blockchain Foundation
I think Velas shouldn't miss this country.
I remember a Carlos Matos conference there :slightly_smiling_face: (440)
I wonder. Will Velas reach $8?
That’s good to know (407)
I’ve go this interesting work on my tab lately
What’s that? (445)
It adlunam (447)
It’s an IDO platform for investors
Which is a proof of attention launch pad for projects
Not really getting what you’re saying mate (450)
Hit the nail in the head man
The market is improving   niiiiiice
Goodmorning everyone,When will the max supply be made public? I want to know if there can be extra minting before I invest
Adlunam is the industry’s first NFT-integrated Engage to Earn seed crowdfunding and IDO launchpad using a Proof of Attention model (452)
100% (455)
You know about it right ?
Yeah I do (457)
Have made little research on it
Is this written in the contract or done manually? Like how does that process work?
Nice!! (459)
Thanks
AdLunamInc have great potential. Why? Because this project is working on a #Launchpad as an initiative to help any kind of project to grow within the #Crypto market exponentially!
Check it out
I love velas
Hello vlx team, first of all acknowledge that vlx has a great vision, but there is a big problem with the current token economy model. The inflationary model is a big burden on the project without an ecosystem and no one will pay for an inflationary currency. go look at BNB which is also all deflationary model. Investors are looking to grow and add value with the project. The fiat currency itself is bad enough for inflation, so why try an inflationary model in a digital currency? And vlx is a DPOS itself many early investors have been able to make a steady stream of profits through pledging, so how do you make it profitable for later investors? Think about it, there are many, many good projects in the world of cryptocurrencies and no one wants to pay for others.
Don't bother with other items, you should consider your own monetary model, inflation means devaluation of the currency. Can you tell us about the benefits of inflation? Why is it designed this way
Why is no one even coming to buy and insisting on inflation? Inflation without demand
So the validator can always arbitrage? What about other investors? They will keep suppressing the price and who will pay for the additional issue?
So everyone comes to pledge and then get the reward to sell for arbitrage, then the value of vlx will keep going lower
So the incentive profit on pledges tends to be close to zero? Then the investment is worthless
We don't see the point at which it can grow.
Bitcoin will always be 2100W, when was it ever increased? Ether too, BNB is even deflationary.
One should look to these growing projects to learn from, rather than crap like BTS, EOS.
The problem is that we don't need inflation, right? Why do we need inflation?
Why don't we let vlx add value to be attractive?
The verifier reward can come out of the total coin pool, although it is a DPOS, then the POW model, but also from the total amount of mining ah.
And POWs also halve in production every four years, which is one of the reasons why they are becoming scarce and sought after.
Think about it yourselves. If it is not profitable and I don't know what my reasons for investing in vlx are, then I have no choice but to quit. I hope you guys can get better and better.
No at btc, that is shown in max.
Happy weekend!
Hello. You are the only one i address with "Hello" because i totally don't agreed at your claim at all as your claim are 1-sided. Your statement itself has lots of big contradicting factors. 1st - you claim that Velas has great vision (so what the great vision in your opinion? Next how can it has not future if got great vision?). 2nd - yet you claim Velas has no ecosystem (then how can it be great vision if it without any ecosystem). 3rd - you claim investors are looking to invest and add values (what type of values are you refer to? purely on coin's price? that's not add values, that's purely invest on coin's price). Maybe you don't even know how to differential "pure coin's investor" and "project development investor". I was also surprise there was someone 2 days ago claim to be from project using SOL looking for alternative (but then also said not exciting after knowing about velas have inflation. Look like he is only looking for coin's price instead of good blockchain solution). (466)
/setdescription@Manybot
I really want to laugh at you and those who thumb up! :face_with_tears_of_joy: (473)
Why not you give "real good" suggestion to add values to overall Velas blockchain? Not just the simple word - burn. Be more real. :OK_hand: (476)
That's BTC model - i thought you said no good? :thinking_face: (478)
Thanks. We will. Within from outside. (479)
Spanish
How much inflation per year?
why do we have so many supply? there should be like voluntary burning of coins. Imagine all of us here 42355 members will voluntarily burn 100 VLX each, that would be 4235500 less VLX in circulation.But in return, those people who voluntarily burned their coins should be posted and be recognized by the community as "HEROES"
Thx and how much is tps 50k or 75k?
Let us stop talking bout inflation or anything debate, let do best for project ahead.I trust VLX will become great things in next future. (482)
I just sell dot to buy vlx
Not dot bdot
Any news is coming??
Actually vlx is better than sol in blockchain ability.Up to 75000 tps, and low gas fee, that is enough to attracted more investor i think. (493)
Every one people burn one of their VLXbut it seems impossiblehaha :grinning_face_with_sweat:
Definitely will. I don't even care about this little inflation for potentially huge velas ecosystem. It's those who don't have foresight and are unable to think objectively. (492)
1000% will. (496)
the things that most important than burn tokens are community expansion and continuing to develop the projects as well.
For sure I will not do this stupid thing for you.. (497)
Hi
Im working on a SocialFi project . My team are very positive that this project will draw the next hype on SocialFi. We are exploring a chain to launch the project.It would be great to partner with your chain on this project. Would you be able share more on how we can get listed on your chain?

Hello, if I want to stablish a local community for Velas, who should I talk to?

It's only a couple of days staking rewards, nothing major (543)
Check please
Don't worry, is the same (548)
For me is ok :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:

Yeah, was a shame that movez wasn't on velas aswell (569)

But something goes wrong
Arrrhhh, ok, didn't know that

Maybe we can collaborate with sweat coin
They are many things to bring people to velas

Haha its my money

Why you don't want send me your velas but you prefer burn it :face_with_tears_of_joy::face_with_tears_of_joy:

Hello. How can I get VLX to my wallet?
I just bought some on gate but when I want to send it to the vallet via velas chain it is not possible. Tokens just come back to exchange... where can be the problem?
I am using  VLX - native and sending to metamask and it is not possible
So I cant send vlx from gate to metamask?
Can't send on velas chain to metamask (you'll need to send to velas wallet and choose velas-native), or send to metamask on bsc chain, then bridge over to velas via swapz. (654)
Ok and then how can I bridge them to velas chain? Because on velaspad bridge you cant bridge VLX. So where can I bridge them?
Swapz dot app, but let admin provide a official link
If you have velas wallet, it'll be cheaper to send from gate to velas wallet and then swap within the velas wallet from native vlx to vlxevm and then send to metamask .The above will be cheaper then using swapz site (0.02bnb to swap there I believe)
When solve problems with Probit?
Can't he sent native vlx to his velas wallet and convert that to vlxevm within the wallet??
With metamask only?
If you only have matemask wallet and don't want to create yourself a velas wallet, you'll need to send your vlx from gate on bsc chain, then use swapz to bride over to velas (662)
Ok I can use the swapz. Can you give me the link plase?
Can't post links, only admin can
Ok thanks. I will try it (665)
To be able to send straight to metamask from an exchange, you have to use kucoin or Bitforex and send via vlxevm
HelloMigration from bep20 to native… is it 1st step swap to evm and step2 swap to native?

Hello
:waving_hand::waving_hand:
Hello Do validator rewards accrue on a wallet automatically or it is needed to claim them?
Thank you a lot Are they accrued on a wallet each epoch (~ 2 days)?
​​Velas strives to accelerate the network infrastructure development of Web3 through its $250M Fund & Accelerator Program. :eyes:Velas is looking to attract ambitious teams to join the efficient, scalable, and EVM-compatible Velas ecosystem.
I'm from Saudi Arabia:Saudi_Arabia: and I would love to establish an Arabic community for Velas.Any administration form to fill out?
I got your point The thing is that the amount of VLX on the wallet is the same during a bit more than 4 days, however, the rewards were accrued according to the website. Is it okay?
HelloCan someone refer me to the CMO/CEO/person in charge of marketing?‌‌
Okay
Ok. Thanks :thumbs_up:

If I understood correctlyWe have a release for 4 years.8% in one year32% for 4 yearsIn order to get from 7% to 15%Are we in the middle of inflation?
A new week will be better
Good morning
why big investors don't like velas is that cos the inflation??
No. Just that they are looking for quick money. Better without them. (702)
so why velas rank in cmc going down and down
Market is going up
Velas going dowm
On this quiet night, send my warm wishes and bring my deep nostalgia. May my blessing wash away your day's troubles.
Wag V2 will save vlx (704)
if the all market going down our rank will be stable but our rank is going down fast that mean is only velas now going downour rank was 100 few months agonow 165
From all these comments seem many doesn't know how to analyse. "It's so simple and obvious that some bad hand is targeting velas". (709)
Unfortunately within community still don't unite instead still throw negative comments. All these just fall into their trap.
iam not a bad hand i just wanna explain for why this happened (710)
Did i said you? I don't think (712)
Within this community must trust and unite. Don't fall into their trap. (712)
more people sell, than people buy, that is the reason (704)
Ha-ha! This is the most appropriate explanation! If a coin is hard to find, it will fly! (715)
Need independent quality teams to develop on velas… bad look all projects BZ (715)
This is surface. Dig deeper. Ask the 5 whys! (716)
No one gives an answer! (718)
Hello. Im from CRYPTO CITY. I have a business proposal its about doing an AMA, promoting, and listing token to Mexc/Bkex/Bibox/Hotbit Exchange. Who I can contact to work?
Who can give you an answer? (719)
This (710)
:sign_of_the_horns::kissing_cat:
Probably yes, for sure we need deflation to attract more investors (702)
Everything is going up on the market excepting vlx:man_facepalming_medium_skin_tone:
My major investment
Who is continuing selling, I won…
Wonder
What is the max supply @Hossein_velas
?
What is difference between VLX AND SOLANA project ?
Only asking. If Velas' offers almost zero fees, wich is tokens utility in the proyect? Thanks (Only asking, ok?)
I understand Velas ecosystem its pretty cool. But dont see Velas' token's utility.... Not only utility but the price of the token.
I think he means, if velas has fees of $0.0001 or so, why would anyone need to buy more than say 50-100 vlx, is there any other utility (I believe this is his question)
If the fees are low, for what should I buy (lot of) Vlx. So, if no buyers no price going up
Thats it (734)
Investing
So, maybe the mot powerfull feature at this moment is supporting PoS consensus, which is the soul of the project. Ok, thanks friend. Have a good day :)
hi
Just made a decision i think I will reach the 200,000 VLX tonight so I will just wait like a pimp for the price to reach the 1$ target :bullseye: hope a bull market begin soon
Hi, everybody:)
Do you think the market has stabilized? (740)
Wtf are u talking about (742)
Does velas really have PoS with IA? Or have you canceled that?
I have hearded about that velas has canceled that
For much work
Ohhh okey
Thanks
Wen binance and coinbase ?

Is it better to wait for another bull market than to list now? (749)

Hi i'm trying to bridge my velas busd to bsc but i got this error "Velas EVM balance (0) is not enough to send tx" Anybody know what it means?
That's right i sent even BNB but forgot to send VLX to velas EVM wallet let me try. Thanks
Better to warn specifically what is not enough in wallet app to get rid of simple questions. I thought bridge doesn't have BUSD to swap :)

Hello, I am a fullstack developer and have a lot of experience in web development and blockchain projects(Defi/NFT/Metaverse/Solana).Is there anyone who can engage me in a developer position in their project?Thank you..
if the inflation reach 1.5% is there will stop inflating or will stop reduced inflation?
Personal opinion, when velas has a few thousand projects with real use cases. This little inflation is nothing. (783)
Hope everything goes well (784)
Hopefully, looking forward (785)

Velas will replace Solana (828)
Okay, Question  - As we see there are some other chain like optimism, Trc20, BNB. If i want to use this chain then how i will use it? and whats the fees?
This right now is peak crypto-fear. If you are still sticking to Crypto you are truly a holder and you can go through the worst bear markets
That is too good but curious to know then why price broke down too much like 100%. Because of Solana or Bitcoin? but still 100% from VLX started this journey. 0.5 to 0.006
sorry 0.06
if i want send vlx from exchange to velas wallet, have bep 20 what wallet i need native evm legacy?
But you don't have bep 20 in velas wallet

Good night
This is the way
administrator why is this happening in PROBIT
It says invalid address and if the address is correct
Kucoin
EVM candles not the other
Kucoin doesn't support vlx legacy , this is the vlx that is on probit, you'll need to send to velas wallet vlx legacy address I believe, then bridge to vlxevm or vlx native and send to kucoin (890)
administrator can you give me the link of Velas Wallet
Just some marketing tips to velas team from one of my best coach in this domain, that i humbly know.A) If your grand ma and your nephew understand it. " It's a good Go-To-Market project. "B) If it still existing in at least 30 years. - It's "okay" to invest in it. -C) Have enough humility to admit you need others to learn AND if as a result IT permit the "things" to grow. - " Just get some coffee." -" You are on the right way.

Sir it's important for vlx to list on binance because it will vlx as well as investor and to the world

What moonboi means

We have the ideal scenario to conquer the market, especially due to the quality and capacity of VLX

Hi
Nice to meet you all.
Hello,I just have a simple question to the developers of Velas. My question is : What is the max supply of Velas that there could be or that is decided? And any specific time where the team is planing to sell some to cover expanses of development?
So you mean that the total amount of Velas is in an increasing curve yearly. But it increases between 1.5% ~ 8% yearly?Also any plans for burning the token or will the token continue to increase in the future?
Okey,But that still means that the supply will be increasing and not decreasing (depends how much of that in the market and how much % in cold wallets) But in general the curve of supply is going to continue to increase.
Yes,thanks for answer :thumbs_up:

We have to persevere, we have to win at the end of the day

Has bitorbit started been constructed by Velas Team and sold after ?
Any better news ?
Wonder just why staking is still continuing giving 20% reward if nothing is up :smiling_face_with_sunglasses::smiling_face_with_smiling_eyes:
8% more on bitorbit
And 40% more on staking vlx-bitorb on wagyuswap
Hi everyone
Do you have an explnation for getting out of bitorbit ?
If fact, we deserve it right ?

​​Hello, dear community! Take a look at our new Network in Numbers page. The latest update provides you with information on a regular basis, and it's automatic! We’ve also added several new numbers.#VelasInNumbers
Can we ever reach 100$ like solana ???
secret (1065)
Why secret I listened from someone about velas (1066)
If its marketcap reaches 200 billions usd, then yes.... (1065)
Ha ha ha! No one promised vlx how much a piece! But vlx is definitely worth owning for the long haul!
Means not possible even solana doesn't even had this much Market cap at its peak (1068)
Why is velas a hold for the long haul? Whats the devs working on
Why is it here for the long haul? Why wont it fall off like other cryptos in a bear market?
Thanks for the info
No way if vlx reaches 1 dollars only the mc will hit some were around 220 millon (1065)
Everything is possible, 1, 10, 100, 1000 but we need more projects, more people (1074)
There is 50+ upcoming projects in let's see
OK 70+
Haha
I think vlx can do just 100x with this total supply and MC (1075)
Why you think that? (1079)
70+,says months，but no up，is there any news?
I was thinking the same bro
But let's give them time, they know what they are doing.
Let's hope velas is building something huge with roadmap to
Hope
I think it's not the perfect time to reveal the projects
I prefer to wait and see some roadmap
:winking_face:
Yes,hope  more news can hear
Is there roadmap about 70+ projects
They are 70 now but not the same as before, right now there are 65 live from those 70 (1081)
I would like to share a link to velas army page where there is a list of current projects
Thks
Hey hossein those 70 projects that you talking is without nft projects that we already now?
Velas army should fix the graphic of the website
So we have more 70+ I hope no more nft haha

Imagine 2 mio users. Everybody has 1200vlx.. thats the total supply. :pinched_fingers:

Number of vlx holders is constantly increasing
The market is likely to be lateralized for a while ...and those who don't have too much money to do it, well they put a little bit from time to time and if they don't have any money at all ...they turn off their phone and they enjoy the summer...

Why not available loan for vlx token on kucoin?
When?this is very long process?I think its not fair for vlx
Кто то слышал что про это?
so I knew
I have contact themI hope vlx can push them too
Is there a document/web page that contains all the projects within the Velas ecosystem?
Great, thanks sir
Is the grant program officially at $250 million now? I see both figures written on different pages. Also the article link on the tweet states this will last for three months, does this mean after the period we'll go back to the $100 million? REGARDLESS, very good to see the direction Velas is going, particularly the deal with Ferrari shows the calibre of partnerships the team is capable of, I am sure it wont be the last. When the bull gets going we'll be hitting new highs
%，*ahnu
Thanks for the reply. So is the $250 million coming at a later date?
As long as the reason you invested is still sound, it's best to keep calm. Patience is absolutely key regardless of the investment.

As a solana fork, is Velas expected to have any of the outage issues that Solana had experienced?
Ok. I was just thinking since you run the same guts as solana, you may experience some of the issues they have.

Never underestimate your power to change yourself!
Just bought Velas a few days ago, this team has a solid project. It's only 0.25% of my portfolio, but I will triple down if they make it to the top 10 marketcap
I also decided to talk about Velas in InvestiShare's latest Podcast, good luck team, good luck investors, I've got an epic feeling about this one
We have a product started in August 2021 and the mvp is going to be launched in this month - June 28th.Our product is a yield product - "The first synthetic farming protocol", where it provides convenience for people to do yield farming while they have full ownership of the funds on their wallet.We are looking to launch on Velas chain as well and would like to build partnership with Velas for collaboration.Who should I contact for partnership discussion?
Can't DM as my account is restricted, could you just add me on your contact?
The world is very big, I like to accept the cultures of different countries
a happy day

By the look of it may hit last year price 2-3c, but is not 100% sure. Markets keep dumping. Etherium keeps dumping and both with BTC are taking big dominance piece of the pie. (1341)

What are the next step for Vela blockchain to the 2025 horizon
I have seen a website that talks about retro games associated with the Poligon network. I think it's a good idea. I think that Velas could promote something similar, since they are saying in the forums that this is well accepted. Those who play get some rewards as they level up, which are later exchanged for tokens, but that requires them to have a wallet with Poligon, which produces a very interesting call effect.

Hello everyone
Hi everyone, have a great weekend.
Hello
GM.. somebody knows how the staking works. I staked 2 days ago but no rewards till now
when binance ..
very good
What do you think the market will be like next week?
anyone there?:thinking_face:
hi i wanna buy VLX
Hello
Why 8s not simple the staking. I have done everything right but no rewards so what should I do
Please how it works the staking because two days ago I staked my tokens but no rewards have been granted
7gGo1uD6hVd4Juv5Tj16DrFKJX1Xq2dndYodb4W6vP9k
So how much time I have wait in order to get the rewards
So I have to withdraw first
But you have to filter the right validators in the list
How can I choose the right one
i don't see the moon ser
For that reason I have chosen the last one because he has 0% commission
But the number of staked was 24M of that validator
I ve got 3 messages from 3 hosseinAccount. Telegram is full of scamers
But in velas wallet you have to filter the valid validator
66tsuTSsZBD4mA7MiBDbYFptuQW8S4NyMgCpgEpxpQjtIt is a validator who gives rewards
Ok thanks
It took how much time to unstable.I have done a request withdrawal
I received many call from telegram
